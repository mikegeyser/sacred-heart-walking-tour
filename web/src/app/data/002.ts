    <p>A series of letters between Br Nectaire (in Uitenhage) and two of the O.M.I. priests (Father Monginoux and Father De Lacy), based in Pretoria and Johannesburg, discuss the possibility of bringing the Marist Brothers to the these towns. Marist Superiors in France were worried about ‘faithless, lawless and dirty’ Johannesburg, fearing that the town would ‘vanish in the dust’ like early American pioneer towns. Brother Nectaire convinced his Superiors otherwise and arrangements were made to send Brothers from Europe for schools to be opened in Johannesburg and Pretoria. The letters were written in English (to Father De Lacy) and in French (to Father Monginoux). Some letters discuss the specifics of the Marist mission to Johannesburg and their visions for educational practice. However, Marist missions in Natal and Kimberley ‘appropriated’ the Brothers sent to Pretoria.</p>

    <p>Johannesburg’s first Catholic Mass was said in Ferreira’s camp in February 1887, ten years after the first Catholics (Oblate priests from the O.M.I. missionary congregation) arrived in the then Transvaal Republic in 1878. It was decided the town needed a school for Catholic children and The Holy Family sent six Sisters to set up a Convent school in October 1887. St Mary’s was Johannesburg’s first school. It was such a success that they decided to start a school for boys. The O.M.I. priests, not teachers themselves, wrote to the Marist Brothers, asking them to extend their missions already established elsewhere in South Africa. </p>
<p>There were many delays in getting the Brothers to Johannesburg, due to security concerns, finance and demands from other Marist missions in South Africa.  According to Brother Nectaire, the three Brothers had begun to lose hope that they might ever reach their destination. </p>

<p>“Here are their names: Brother Frederick, Principal, a good little Bourguignon* who has been in the Colony for 10 years already; Brother Albert-Dominic, a courageous Irishman who has been with me here since last March and Brother Euphrase an excellent Belgian who will teach Dutch. Three excellent pious men who will be an asset to you and edifying for your parish.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Brother Frederick was the new Marist school’s first Principal for thirteen years, until 1903 when he was made Marist Provincial for the newly created administrative Province of South Africa. He was seen as a fatherly figure by his pupils, famed around the school for always carrying a small black bag containing sweets and sticks that he dished out to appropriately reward or rebuke deserving pupils. Brother Frederick died three weeks before his 100th birthday in 1946, having survived the cyclone that killed Brother Euphrase in Basutoland in 1912, where they had been posted after Koch Street. Brother Albert-Dominic died after an illness in 1894.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>According to records, 27 pupils (7 Catholics, 12 non-Catholics and 8 Jews) arrived to register on the first day, Wednesday 9th October 1889. The first school pupil to arrive at the new school was Peter Busschau (in 2017 there are still Busschaus from the same family at Marist schools). Not long after Busschau’s arrival, a wagonload of boys came from the End Street Convent, run by the Holy Family Sisters, bringing their desks with them. Within the first two years the school roll stood at 300 pupils. In these early days the school was known as Marist Brothers’ College. </p>
<p>The single-storey building in the background was the school house – divided inside with wood and glass panels into three classroom areas. This became the ground floor of the western wing of the Koch street premises as it started to grow. The playground at this stage was open veld, for Doornfontein was not yet built up. </p>
<p>In this photograph the boy on the tricycle is identified as George Nolan – later to become uncle of Brother Paul, a much beloved member of the Eckstein Street community of Marist Brothers. Another of the boys here, as recorded in the Marist Archives (but not clearly identifiable due to the quality of the image) is Joe Geddes – later to become a teacher at the school and after whom one of the school houses is named. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>By 1890 the school roll had reached 800 and the school building was far too cramped to accommodate even half of the boys; thus a new double-storey school house was constructed. Even so, the most junior pupils still couldn’t be accommodated within the new building and nearly 200 of them were taught in a marquee pitched in the playground, with others timetabled to sports and other subjects taught in areas around the playground. No longer open veld, the walled playground, which doubled as a cadet training ground and cricket field/soccer pitch, also contained a cottage where the Brothers (and their beehives) resided, a gym, a greenhouse, a woodwork room, a chapel and prototype science laboratory (which pupils were charged an extra fee to use). Space at Koch Street was already becoming tight. </p>
<p>The school was creating quite a reputation for itself in Johannesburg. Gymnastic displays put on by the school became quite a societal fixture, with such big crowds of people turning out to watch that the school yard was not big enough, and the Wanderers grounds were used for displays. The boys were invited to take part in the annual Carnival Procession through the streets of the city and again in special displays (on foot, on bicycles, with gym equipment, in Reed or Brass Bands leading the Cadet Corps) for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897 and the Coronation of King Edward in 1902.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>During the South African War, the school roll dropped to 150 and a part of the school was turned into a military hospital under the care of the French Red Cross, assisted by the Brothers. By 1905 the pupil numbers rose back to over 500, and by 1906 the school was re-extended, this time into a triple-storey building. By 1914 the school roll was over 600 again and plans began to take shape, not to extend the existing school (impossible due to the ever increasing density of the Doornfontein neighbourhood), but to look for another site further afield. Around 1918 this additional land was found in Observatory and purchased in 1919 by the Marist Provincial (The Revd. Brother Vital) for development as soon as possible, following the settling down of socio-economics after WW1.</p>
<p>In a letter to his Lordship, Right Rev. Dr William Miller, Vicar Apostolic of the Transvaal, written in 1910, Br Frederick defended the particular nature of Sacred Heart School at Koch Street. The Catholic administration had accused the school of not being ‘Catholic’ enough and of having too many ‘other’ pupils. Brother Frederick assured the Right Rev. Miller that Catechism classes, the Rosary and regular Masses made provision for the Catholic boys, of whom there were 135 on the roll. This implies that there were at least 450 non-Catholic children attending the school (at the time most likely Jewish and Protestant children) – a diverse and inclusive Catholic school, as Sacred Heart College remains today. </p>

    <p>By the 1960s the land around Sacred Heart College was entirely built up. This view shows how close the school was to the train tracks that led to Park Station and how little room, if at all, there was for expansion. The block on which Sacred Heart College stood is bordered by Koch Street to the north, Claim Street to the east, Hancock Street to the south and Banket Street to the east. </p>
<p>As is visible from this photograph, there was no room for expansion of the original school, which since the late 1920s had served as the preparatory school for Sacred Heart College in Observatory and later also for St. David’s College, Inanda. St.David’s College opened in 1940 after the Marist Brothers had purchased land north of Rosebank to build a new school. It was clear from the early 1930s that even two Marist schools could not accommodate the number of applicants wishing to be taught by the Brothers. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Brothers sold the land at Koch Street in the mid 1960s as the ever developing city centre had become an unsuitable area for a school . A site to the south and (at the time) far away from construction in town was bought in Linmeyer. The final assembly at Sacred Heart College on the Koch Street site was held in 1965. </p>
<p>In 1966 The Star reported that many Old Boys from Koch Street had gone to the site when demolition started to salvage mementos from the buildings, like bricks to set into their homes – such was the sentiment surrounding the school. In 1966 Marian College Linmeyer was opened. The Koch Street foundation stone and the organ from the chapel were incorporated into this new Marist school. Most of the boys from the younger years at Koch Street transferred to Marian College Linmeyer, since Observatory only admitted boys from Standard 3 (grade 5 today) until the late 1970s. Some of the older boys went to the established Marist Colleges in Observatory and Inanda. Since Koch Street had been the preparatory school for Sacred Heart, or Marist Obs as it was known, Sacred Heart Koch Street can be considered as the mother school of Sacred Heart College. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Mariston, a 31-storey building appropriately named with a nod to the former landowners, opened in 1971. One part of the school building (seen here) was left standing for some time after the Mariston was constructed, but this has since also been demolished and built over. The Mariston Building, which is still standing today, was created as a multi-usage building with 550 flats. A swimming pool, restaurant and landscaped gardens were planned at the time of construction but it isn’t clear that this was followed through. Today a hotel occupies the first six floors, with student accommodation, short term lets and other premises on the remaining levels. </p>
