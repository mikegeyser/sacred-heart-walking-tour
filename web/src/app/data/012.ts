    <p>The Brothers always lived, as they do today, in community residence at Marist institutions that they served. Prior to 1985, the Brothers based at Sacred Heart College lived in rooms on the upper floor of the main building, which today have been converted into the staff room and several offices (including those of the school counsellor and the Chaplain). In 1985 a new residence was completed for the Brothers, providing rooms for 11 Brothers, a mall Chapel space, a dining room and a communal lounge. The single storey building, partly incorporating the Manual Training Hall, was practically designed to comfortably accommodate more elderly Brothers. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Vidal arrived in South Africa in 1902 suffering ‘galloping consumption’ (tuberculosis) and doctors in Cape Town gave him three months to live. He moved to Johannesburg where the altitude strengthened his lungs, and astounded the medical profession by not only living to the age of 95 but by becoming a PT teacher, gymnastics enthusiast and soccer coach.  Another article in The Star (undated) reported that he volunteered as a traffic cop ensuring that learners were able to safely cross the roads to and from school. The 1962 Maristonian remarked in his obituary that “perhaps he will be best remembered among the laity for his many remedies for almost all sorts of diseases. For some these proved beneficial, for others a trial that was not repeated.” Brother Martin, the late Marist Archivist, kept a list of his remedies and noted that it was the ‘Hail Marys’ offered at the end of each treatment that were the only potentially non-lethal part of the process!</p>
<p>Over the 150 years that the Marists have been in Johannesburg many hundreds of Brothers have served to educate the youth at the three Gauteng Marist schools. Their presence has impacted the wider community in numerous ways. Some of these Brothers are mentioned in this App; these are but a selection. In this group of slides, the main focus is on the Brothers who lived, or continue to live, at the Eckstein Street Brothers’ Residence. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Paul became a Marist Brother just a few years after finishing school (Athlone Boys’ High School) in Johannesburg in 1924. Br Paul trained in Italy, and on returning to South Africa in 1926 taught at many of the Marist Schools, including Koch Street and Observatory. He was elected to represent the South African Brothers at the General Chapter in Italy in 1946. He then spent some years recruiting for the Province of South Africa in northern Europe. In 1957, having suffered degenerative eyesight by this time, he had an operation in London. The operation was not successful and Br Paul was thereafter totally blind. </p>
<p>Br Paul returned to South Africa to live with the Brothers at Observatory, where he remained until 1998 when he moved to a Catholic care facility, Nazareth House in Yeoville. The boys at the school organised a collection for Br Paul to buy his guide dog. He learnt braille and immersed himself in charitable work to assist the blind, particularly in social welfare. In 1967, Br Paul founded “The Guild of St. Theresa for the Blind”, a charitable institution, assisted by the Sisters of Charity to practically assist and financially support the blind in disadvantaged communities. The Siloe School for the Blind, near Pietermaritzburg, is one of the foundations supported by St. Theresa’s Guild. Br Paul’s obituary, published in 2000 in the College Yearbook, commented that the children at the Siloe School &#39;know more about Br Paul than they do about the Pope!&#39;</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Jude describes himself as ‘working with young people’, but this only tells one small portion (though with a huge impact) of his contribution to transformative processes in South African society. Educated at St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch from Standard 2 (grade 4 today), he professed his first Marist vows in 1959. Brother Jude taught in Marist Brothers’ Colleges in Observatory and in Walmer, Port Elizabeth, where he was Principal from 1969. In 1974, Br Jude was appointed Provincial of South Africa, a position he held for nine years. Following this, at the request of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Southern Africa (SACBC), he founded the Catholic Institute of Education. From 1988 until 1995 he served as Secretary General of the SACBC until re-appointment as Provincial of South Africa. From 1998, until 2003, Br Jude was Provincial of the new Marist Province of Southern Africa which, besides South Africa, involves the Brothers and their institutions in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Today he is a Councillor for the Southern African Province. </p>
<p>As Director of the Catholic Institute of Education and later as Secretary General of the SACBC, in the 1980s and ‘90s Br Jude was a driving force in talks with the then Government around the desegregation of Catholic schools in South Africa. Over the years he has contributed to positive changes in the country, not least in missions relating to social justice and in terms of the development of national and Catholic education policies. In 1999 Br Jude set up the Marist Schools Council, which oversees the administration of the five Marist schools in South Africa.  </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Born in Port Elizabeth, Brother Joseph was educated at Marist College in Uitenhage (as was his father) and the Marist Juniorate in Hibberdene, KZN. Like all Marist Brothers of his generation he spent a year in a Postulancy (preparation to enter the next stage of Marist formation) and a further year at a Novitiate (during which ones’ first vows are made). Br Joseph’s Novitiate year included teaching practice at St. David’s, Inanda, after which he taught at Marian College, Linmeyer, St. Charles’ College, Pietermaritzburg, and St. Joseph’s, Rondebosch, where he was Primary School Principal. In the 1980s Br Joseph was the founder Principal of Trinity High School in Port Elizabeth (a joint venture between the Marists and the Dominican Sisters) and spent a year as Superintendent for the Diocesan Mission Schools. </p>
<p>From 1991-2000 Br Joseph was Principal of the Primary School at Sacred Heart College which he fondly recalls as ‘a great ten years of my apostolic life’. Br Joseph oversaw the move of the Foundation Phase back to the Eckstein Street premises from its temporary home in Yeoville. Br Joseph, a gentle but firm, much loved Principal, was appointed to join the staff of the Brothers’ tertiary formation house in Nairobi in 2000. In 2005 he returned to live at the Brothers’ Residence at Sacred Heart on his election as Deputy Marist Provincial and from 2010-2016 served two terms as Marist Provincial for Southern Africa. Brother Joseph recently moved from Observatory to continue Marist mission work in the Western Cape. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Mario’s elder brother taught him the war cry for St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch well before he became there a pupil in the early 1950s. Aged 15 he decided to become a Marist and moved to the Hibberdene Juniorate to complete his secondary schooling. After his postulancy and novitiate in Australia (completed contemporaneously with Brother Jude), he returned to South Africa. After obtaining a B.Sc. degree at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg, he taught at St David’s College, Inanda for 14 years. During this period he studied part-time through UNISA ending with a Masters in Education. He is grateful to the Superiors for allowing him to take advantage of a bursary to follow a summer programme at the University of California (science teaching), and another one at the University of Louvain (theology) many years later. He has also benefitted from a renewal programme in Rome and a year of study at the Gregorian University in the same city. He has served as a teacher in two former South African homelands and spent eight years as a formator at the Marist International College in Nairobi. </p>
<p>On returning to South Africa, Br Mario devoted a number of years to formation of Marist educators in the spirit of St Marcellin. In 2010, he was appointed as Secretary to the Province of Southern Africa and personal secretary to Brother Joseph, the Provincial Superior. He currently continues that service under Brother Norbert who replaced Br Joseph in 2016.</p>

    <p>In 1957, aged 8, Brother Vincent began boarding with the Marists at St. Charles’ College, Pietermaritzburg. From there he went to the Marist Juniorate in Hibberdene, Natal. In 1968 he took his first vows at the Marist Novitiate (together with Brother Joseph) in Stellenbosch. In 1971, after a year at the Marist Scholasticate in Pietermaritzburg, Br Vincent came to Marist ‘Obs’ to teach Standard 5 and coach sports and the Cadet band. Br Vincent recalls walking to Ellis Park Stadium and the Yeoville Bioscope with Brother Neil on occasional weekends. His bedroom is now the College Counsellor’s office. </p>
<p>In 1973 Br Vincent continued his Marist formation in Australia, thereafter spending fifteen years between Marist schools in Port Elizabeth and Durban. Posted to the Slough Marist mission in the Kalahari Desert in 1986, he taught in the local school and cultivated his interest in practical work. In 1990 he received an H.D.Ed in Technical Studies at the Johannesburg College of Education. He taught Technical Studies at Slough and at the Xhosa-speaking Dominican Convent High School in Uitenhage until 2007, when he transferred back to Sacred Heart as Maintenance Manager, a role he continues today.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Neil, whose uncle Gerald McGurk taught at Sacred Heart College for 43 years, and whose uncle Edwin McGurk was Provincial in the 1950s and 60s, began his own journey with Marist ‘Obs’ aged 14. Br Neil began teaching science at Marist ‘Obs’ in 1965. A veritable academic, with reams of published research in topics as diverse as education and race, cosmology and nucleic forces, he has inspired generations of learners. From 1975 to 1999 he was Director of the College. Sim Tshabalala, now joint CEO of Standard Bank, and one of the first black students admitted to the College, said of his former Headmaster:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I learned a lot from him and in particular, I gained a love of philosophy and deep desire to help out – at least a little – to make South Africa a better place.”      (Tshabalala, 2011)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under Br Neil’s leadership, the College defied government decree and opened the school to boys of all races in 1976. In 1980, he was responsible for the change to co-education and the integrated studies curriculum. Br Neil has made invaluable contributions to South African society, including negotiating educational reform with the pre-1994 government, leading to the remodelling and desegregation of schools, assisting the ANC before and after its unbanning with socio-cultural missions, and the integration of returning exiles in conjunction with the Batlagae Trust. Br Neil continues to work tirelessly for social development with Catholic NGOs in the country; one current project, ‘The Culture of Learning’ in KZN, provides skill training in education and community development.  </p>

    <p>Marist Brothers are not priests, but have nonetheless made vows to live a spiritual life in community with other Brothers, focused on education as their founder, Marcellin Champagnat (who was a priest), established in 1817. Father David Dryden, not a Marist Brother but a Jesuit Priest, has been the Sacred Heart College Chaplain since 1983, after serving at St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch, for the previous decade. Father Dryden is concurrently the Chaplain at Marian College, Linmeyer and he devotes one day each week to each school. </p>
<p>Father Dryden’s duties as Chaplain include pastoral care, religious instruction for Catholic children and religious education in a general sense, as well as conducting Masses and other special ceremonies (such as First Holy Communion and Confirmation). He has contact in these capacities with all ages at the school, from Pre-Primary to Matric, and also with staff members.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>This statue of Our Lady of Good Hope was made in Europe and sent by Br Procope, Marist Superior in the 1880s, to the Marist College at Uitenhage, Our Lady of Good Hope College at a cost of £7 and 15 shillings, according to the Uitenhage annals of 1890, recorded by Br Nectaire. When that College closed in the 1950s, the statue was moved to Port Elizabeth, where the Brothers in that area continued to live. When Br Joseph became Principal of the Primary School at Sacred Heart College he arranged for the statue to be moved to Johannesburg, for he had developed a fondness for it during his days as a learner at the Marist College in Walmer. When Br Joseph was made Provincial in 2010 he arranged for a copy of the statue to be made, and it is this copy that sits in the niche in the College façade today. The niche had been empty for nearly thirty years after the statue of Jesus with the Sacred Heart was moved from that spot in 1979 when the school reverted to the use of its religious name upon becoming co-educational in 1980. </p>
