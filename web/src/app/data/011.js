Their design references the Sacred Heart of Jesus from where the College takes its name and to the love with which everything in the workshop is made or repaired. The Maintenance and Ground Staff, not all of whom are based in this building, are responsible for the cleaning, repair and upkeep of the College buildings and facilities. Their skills range from carpentry to welding, from tiling to landscaping, and from catering provision to security monitoring. As individuals they  are integral to the College community.",

    <p>The College Workshop is situated in the building where the Boarders’ Laundry and Ironing used to be done. The Workshop was originally in the northern basement of the main College building (where the printing room and school Nurse can be found) but the noise of the machinery in use during class time meant that it became necessary to find an alternative space. When a Laundry for the Boarders was no longer required the Workshop was moved from the basement to the Laundry building.  </p>

    <p>Gratitude to the Maintenance and Support staff is shown in a variety of ways by members of the College community. Masses are held to celebrate their contribution to the College, and parents host an annual Appreciation Breakfast. The relations between the non-teaching staff and the learners are genuinely reciprocal. The support staff are often included when learners bring baked goods to share with their peers and teachers on their birthdays. The ground staff are often present at College sports matches and, when they can, assist children in accessing items mistakenly left behind after hours. </p>

The College has two boreholes on the property, one of which dates back to the 1920s when the grounds were prepared for use as a school, and is located within the Workshop building itself. The pump has since been replaced but the hole has remained a plentiful source of water for the College to this day. Water from the two boreholes (the second is located on the top field) is combined with a municipal supply in this tower tank.",

    <p>The image of the Tower was taken before the Main Quadrangle was renovated in the late 1990s. The piazza of the quadrangle was liable to flooding in heavy rains; the after effects of this can be seen in the lower right hand corner of the image. </p>

    <p>Joseph Letebele trained in carpentry at Pax College (Pietersburg) with the Brothers of Charity. Starting with a holiday job in July 1959, he was invited back for a probationary period as a handyman in 1961. From 1962, Joseph Letebele was permanently employed, as school Carpenter and “proved to be quite indispensable. He knows where every fuse is to be found, where every key fits, the intricacies of the swimming pool filter, the condition of every desk… the list is endless” (1989 College Yearbook).</p>
