    <p>The Brothers however always wore ‘uniform’ when performing their duties at school. Their black soutanes (robes) with white starched split rectangular collars earned them the nickname “crows” amongst the boys both at Koch Street and at Observatory. </p>
<p>The first official and compulsory uniforms were introduced at the former Marist school in Pietermaritzburg (then Maritzburg) in 1927 by then Principal Br Paul-Camille. This consisted of a blue blazer with a braid of alternate sections of blue and gold around the edges of the lapel, pockets and cuffs. Br Paul-Camille, who had been stationed at the Cala Marist Brothers College in then Tembuland in the early 1900s, possibly took the idea from the blue and gold uniform worn by cadets there at the time. The earliest evidence of the blue and gold combination as “Marist” in South Africa is in the 1903 edition of the Marist College Uitenhage magazine called “Blue &amp; Gold”. As the Uitenhage college was the fifth Marist school to open in South Africa, it is likely that these colours had already been adopted at the earlier schools in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, but no documentation exists to confirm this. Br Paul-Camille became Principal at Sacred Heart (Observatory) in 1935.   </p>

    <p>In 1933, the striped blazer replaced a plain blue blazer with a blue and gold edging after the Provincial Council of South African Marists’ resolution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The uniform of all Marist schools in the country must include a light navy-blue blazer of Venetian cloth with pairs of gold-yellow stripes an eighth inch wide and an eight inch apart, at a distance of 1 ½ inch between each pair.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Marist Centenary Digest (1967) explains the blue and gold combination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some claim that the colours were brought to South Africa from St Joseph’s College at Dumfries in Scotland. Others say that the blue was chosen for Marist (blue for Our Lady) and the gold from the white and gold of the Papal colours… that blue is the colour of the heavens which bids us cherish the highest ideals; and that gold represents the sterling qualities of character which the Brothers endeavour to instil in their pupils.”</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>M.B.C stood for Marist Brothers College and was emblazoned below the badge with the Marist monogram AM at Sacred Heart Colleges at Koch Street and at Observatory. The monogram consists of the letters A and M intertwined representing the Marist’s motto Ad Jesum per Mariam (To Jesus through the way of Mary). AM as a Catholic monogram (usually standing for Ave Maria – praise/hail Mary) is not unique to the Marist Brothers but AM in this distinctive yellow and blue script is internationally associated with the Marist family.</p>
<p>This blazer crest, with M.B.J, is still used on ‘ordinary’ blazers (as opposed to Honours blazers) at St David’s College, Inanda and at Marian College, Linmeyer. Blazer badges in the past were not necessarily the same as that of the school badges or crests; today, however, the College crest is the one that appears on the blazer badge. </p>

    <p>This badge shown was used on Honours blazers only (with varying blues and widths of stripes used until the 1980s) and was used only until the 1960s. After that it was used as a blazer badge for ‘ordinary’ school blazers in the 1970s. Today plain blue blazers recognise outstanding academic, sports and cultural achievement as well as community service. In order to get a blue blazer, High School learners first have to be awarded a gold badge and then a scroll. LLC Presidents wear plain blue blazers with a gold piping (rather like the first school blazers).  The badge shown has three gold stampers in the top right segment, similar to the crest of the City of Johannesburg and an allusion to the location of the College being in the mining town. The left-hand symbol is the lamp of learning and below it is the AM monogram. The reason for the addition of the green and red was perhaps was a way to include the two other school house colours not represented by the blue and gold already in the crest. The school motto ‘In Meliora Contende’, meaning ‘strive for better things’, is embroidered at the bottom of the badge.</p>

    text: "The Sacred Heart College badge designed in 1980 when the school became co-educational.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>This badge was designed by Sister Mara O.S.U. who was Deputy Principal of the Junior Primary school at the time. It combined symbols from the three schools that joined together in 1980. These three schools were Sacred Heart College Observatory, Holy Family Convent, Yeoville and St. Angela’s Convent, Bezuidenhout Valley. The AM monogram for Sacred Heart College (or Marist Obs) is preserved in the badge. The Holy Family Convent (which continued to house the Sacred Heart nursery school until the 1990s) shamrock, representing the Holy Family (Jesus, Mary and Joseph), is found at the bottom right. The seven stars in the Ursuline badge (for St Angela’s Convent was run by the Ursuline Order) are arranged in the constellation of Ursula Minor. In this badge the seven stars are rearranged and attached to the Cross, the symbol of Christianity, which bound all three schools together. The Cross was represented with a crook at the top. A crook is used by both Bishops and shepherds –  for both it is a tool that speaks to the care and management of a flock. </p>

    <p>Both the Primary and High Schools were permitted to wear a mix of blazer badges until the mid 1980s in the years immediately after the amalgamation of schools. In this image you can make out at least three (the old and new badge at Sacred Heart, and the Ursuline badge). The dresses worn by the girls were also a mix of styles – today’s ‘banana dress’ is an adaptation of the dress that came from Holy Family, Yeoville (seen on the girl on far left). Another style of dress, a pinafore with collarless shirt underneath, from St Angela’s, was also worn (seen on the girl in far right of picture).</p>
<p>In 1986 the College proposed a two section High School with either Afrikaans or English offered as the medium of instruction (rather than only English). In addition, Sotho, French, Portuguese and Italian were offered as second languages. Though the whole school (Nursery, Primary and High School) was to retain the name Sacred Heart College, the High School was renamed Observatory College/Kollege. Both instruction medium groups were combined for sporting and cultural activities but split for Languages, Mathematics, Physical and Social Sciences. This dual first language programme lasted only a couple of years.       </p>

    <p>This badge, created in 1985 by Kobus Esterhuizen, symbolised the Afrikaans/English initiative, but has lasted for at least thirty years longer than the initial reason for its design. The Cross with crook is set within a Huguenot Cross to signify the union of both the Catholic and Reformed theological traditions within the mediums of instruction to be offered. The Alpha and Omega, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, used together signify wholeness, and were incorporated to symbolise the diverse (religious, racial and cultural) and co-educational nature of the school. The hearts in the centre are the three petals of the Holy Family shamrock and a fourth for the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The stars from the Ursuline badge (only five can be seen, the other two are artistically ‘hidden’ behind the logo) are those of the constellation Ursula Minor (or little bear), which points to the Pole star, traditionally the star towards which one looks to for direction. As such, the badge speaks to more than just the dual language programme that it was created around, but commemorates the union of three schools and celebrates the diverse and inclusive nature of the College community.</p>
