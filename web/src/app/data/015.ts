    <p>The Senior Primary, or Intermediate (grades 4-6) Quad was officially opened in March 1989, the centenary year of the Marist Brothers’ arrival in Johannesburg. The foundation stone was unveiled by Mr K. O’Dowd, Chairman of Anglo American’s Chairman’s Fund, one of the main funders of the new premises (along with the De Beers Chairman’s Fund and the JCI Fund). The relationship between the donors and the school came through shared insights around educational development and provision at a national level. The Marist Brothers, College staff and community members, together with representatives from these corporations, held talks with the Department of Education that led to reinvestment in schooling, both in private schools like Sacred Heart College and in Model C and D schools in central Johannesburg in the late 1980s and early 1990s; a period of critical change.</p>
<p>At the time of the Senior Primary Quad opening the school was implementing an innovative curriculum of Integrated Studies for those in the bridging years of Primary and High school (grades 7 and 8). This was a consolidation of subject teaching, particularly in the social sciences, which provided a common focus on literacy, numeracy and language learning, and was designed to accommodate and integrate learners from different educational and language backgrounds. The subject matter provided a balanced historical perspective and was taught in relation to real life experiences that encouraged interaction amongst the diverse student body. </p>

    <p>All over the College grounds, in windows, on plaques, in the form of benches, artworks or dedicated spaces there are memorials to those members of the school community who have died. Many more of course are recalled through the memories of those who have attended or still attend the college and not all have a physical marker in the school space to their earthly existence. Each one, in their own way, made a special contribution to the family spirit of Sacred Heart College. </p>
<p>This stained-glass window, created by Barry Thompson, who produced most of the windows in the Memorial Chapel, commemorates the life of Bebe Mothopeng, 1982-2004. Bebe, a member of the Learners Leadership Council, matriculated from the College in 2001. She was in the third year of her Bachelor of Education degree at UNISA, completing her teaching practice at Sacred Heart College, when she died in 2004 after a short illness. Like many members of her family, Bebe was a musician and had been a member of both the Soweto Youth Orchestra and the Johannesburg Youth Orchestra as a wind instrumentalist. She also sang in the Nightingale Children’s Choir.</p>

    <p>In the final school assembly of 1993, when all learners were housed in the classrooms on the Observatory site (the Junior Primary learners moved from Yeoville in 1993), a prayer for peace was said by the whole school. It was a time of national uncertainty before the first democratic elections in the country in 1994. A visiting German journalist who witnessed the prayer described the spirit of the diverse and united school community as a beacon of hope for the country. The Director of the Peace Pole Project (an international organisation that began in Japan in the 1950s), after reading the article, decided the College would be a fitting location for a South African Peace Pole. </p>
<p>The whole school and members of the wider community took part in an elaborate ceremony to put up a peace pole to the right of the stage area in 1994. On its four sides it read “May Peace Prevail On Earth” in isiZulu, Afrikaans, Sesotho and English. The quad was renovated some years later and the pole was removed. Perhaps it has not been re-installed because the message of tolerance, unity and diversity has long been learnt at Sacred Heart. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Integrated Studies Curriculum was a concrete example of the innovative approach to education undertaken at Sacred Heart College. As a Marist school, it is underpinned by and strengthened through values that come directly from the unique application of Marcellin Champagnat’s educational vision that stemmed from his understanding of the Gospel message and which lies at the core of Marist schools today. These values can be understood as five pedagogical (or educational practice) pillars or characteristics that uphold and inform the educational framework of the school. These five characteristics are named as presence, simplicity, family spirit, love of work and following the way of Mary. </p>
<p>Mary, the mother of Jesus, is understood as the perfect model of the Marist educator. Faithful and loving, she knew both the joys and the trials of life. In her way, Marist educators seek to lead by example and above all to encourage the personal growth of their learners by establishing relationships with them based on love and humility. The family spirit that is encouraged is evidenced in the relationships built between learners of all ages and at all stages in their school life, supported by their teachers, with whom a strong community is built. This simple, modest attentiveness sets the Marist and Sacred Heart Community apart from others – the nurturing of ‘doing good, quietly’ in a school setting encourages hard work, application and mindfulness.  </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>This photograph, from the archive of Museum Africa, shows Sacred Heart College learners handing over gifts that had been collected in 1932 for a relief fund during the worldwide economic depression, which also affected South Africa. A connection between the Rotary Club and Sacred Heart College remains to this day in joint efforts for charitable works. In 2016, the Rotary Club’s “Stop Hunger” food packing drive was assisted by High School learners and staff. </p>
<p>The five Marist pillars include presence, love of work and family spirit. These characteristics are seen in many ways within the school community (e.g. the whole school supporting the Three2Six education project) but also in connection with wider community projects. Charitable work is more than just a donation; it involves presence, application (and fun!). This can be seen in a number of projects that the children take part in, like the yearly Red and White Days and Rollerblade Disco, which raise funds for a local children’s home, or the collection of bottled water for national distribution during the droughts of 2015/2016.</p>

    <p>Charitable giving and works are an important part of the Sacred Heart College community spirit. This begins in the Pre-Primary where weekly collections of donated extra packed lunches are passed onto a ‘meals on wheels’ service for the elderly and homeless. Older learners are encouraged to support causes they select; examples of these are the 2016 grade 5s initiative to hold a ‘SleepOut’ to raise funds for the destitute, and the High School’s Enviro-Club and Eco Committee, awarded International Green Flag Status by Generation Earth (a US based environmental education programme) in 2016. </p>
