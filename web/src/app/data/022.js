    furtherText: `
    <p>Born Christopher Hagan in Ireland in 1889, Br Macartin arrived in South Africa in 1920. He taught at several of the Marist schools in South Africa, including Sacred Heart College at Koch Street, Uitenhage and Pietermaritzburg, and was headmaster of five Marist schools. However, it was at Observatory that he spent most of his teaching career, both in the classroom, on the sports field and with the Cadet Corps. </p>
<p>Brother Macartin was decorated with several medals, some of which are pictured here. These included one awarded by Queen Elizabeth II for services to education, the King George medal for long and meritorious service as a Cadet Officer, a medal for being the best at Musketry in the British Empire, the African Medal for services on the Home Front during the Second World War and a gold medallion sent by Pope John Paul II when Brother Macartin had served 70 years as a Brother. </p>

    <p>Brother Macartin, for whom the sports centre is named, was a celebrated teacher and sportsman (soccer and cricket) until an accident slightly lamed him. As a result, he was nicknamed “Hoppy” by the boys. When too elderly to coach sports, but before his retirement to Nazareth House, he was to be found polishing and ordering the school sports equipment in “Hoppy’s Hole” (now the Alumni and Marketing Office). He was not the only Brother with a zeal for sport but his death, in 1990, was timeous with the construction of the new sports and community centre. </p>
<p>Brother Macartin could also be considered as one of the pioneers of Marist “Obs”. In c.1918 Brother Macartin, taking a Sunday stroll with some of his peers, came across the land at Eckstein Street and remarked it would be a suitable site for the expansion of the school. Since the sports facilities were inadequate at Koch Street, it was the idea of sprawling playing fields that particularly caught Br Macartin’s attention. </p>

    <p>During the 1930s and 1940s thousands of Catholics from all over the Johannesburg area congregated at Sacred Heart College in Observatory to celebrate the Feast of Corpus Christi. As is traditional, Corpus Christi (a celebration of the bodily presence of Jesus in the Eucharistic service) is celebrated on the second Sunday after Pentecost, approximately six weeks after Easter. The festival was marked with a procession, Mystery Plays and with the celebration of the Eucharist at several points around the College grounds. One altar for this purpose was set up in the arched entrance to the swimming pool – seen in this image with the double columns on either side of the archway.     </p>
<p>This entrance to the swimming pool is still in existence at Sacred Heart College, though its position has since moved and its structure adapted. The building of the Macartin Centre alongside the swimming pool area meant that the entrance to the pool shifted westwards. The same gate from the 1930s has been incorporated into an adapted gateway to the swimming pool today.  </p>
<p>The Macartin Centre and Memorial Chapel were constructed on the very garden area that held thousands of people at the Corpus Christi Festival. When the Memorial Chapel was built, this area became a landscaped lawn shaded by trees serving as a meditational space.  In 1969, the College Library was added. This is the extension that comes off the cloistered walkway to the Chapel and today contains Foundation Phase classrooms. </p>

    <p>The Brother Macartin Indoor Sports &amp; Community Centre was officially opened on 18th July 1992 by The Right Reverend Reginald Orsmond, Bishop of Johannesburg. The opening of the Macartin Centre was organised by Linda Giuricich (née Woock), who taught PE and Standard 3 for 20 years and was Principal of the Foundation Phase (then located at Yeoville Convent) for six years. Linda also organised the Cultural Festival, which was the forerunner of the current-day Heritage Day Music Festival. Linda Giuricich is the granddaughter of Richard Hurly, after whose farm Hurlyvale in Edenvale is named. Generations of both the Hurly and Giuricich families attended Koch Street, Marist ‘Obs’ and Yeoville Convent. Richard’s six sons and brother, Henry Hurly, attended Sacred Heart College (at both sites). Of their sons, Richard (junior), was Head Boy and another, Charles, a Springbok soccer player. Ten grandchildren and great-grandchildren followed suit. </p>
<p>The Giuricich brothers, who were builders, brought soil (dug up when building the Rosebank Mall) to level some of the school playing fields in the 1960s. Linda’s grandmother, Myrtle Hurly, chaired the Ladies’ Committee that raised the funds to build The Memorial Chapel. Linda recalls that her grandfather Richard Hurly received the first Marist Brothers who arrived from Kimberley by ox wagon in 1887, as they stopped at the Hurly dairy farm before continuing to Johannesburg. Today Linda runs Aerials Rhythmic Gymnastics club from the College, based at the school since 1980. Chantal Moonsammy and Nadia Harris, 2006 Springbok gymnasts and Sacred Heart alumni, were her students. Two current learners who train at Aerials represent Gauteng, and alumnus Sara Feldman won South African titles for four consecutive years. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Macartin Centre is foremost a sports hub but has many other uses in line with its original purposing as a Sports and Community Centre. Three times a year whole school Masses are held in the space as it is the only indoor space large enough to hold the Pre-Primary, Primary, High School and Three2Six School that together make up Sacred Heart College. </p>
<p>The first term Mass is the Academic Mass, which honours girls and women and acknowledges the role of the Ursuline Sisters in the College’s history. In the second term the Mass is held in memory of St Marcellin Champagnat, and the third term Mass celebrates Sacred Heart Day. A much loved tradition at these Masses is when the school ‘elders’ – the matrics – lead in the Grade 1s, who are just embarking on their school careers. This is a physical reminder of the strength of relations between pupils of all stages and walks of life at Sacred Heart College. On Sacred Heart Day cool drinks and sticky buns are served as a treat to learners, a tradition that goes right back to the Koch Street days. </p>

    text: "Sacred Heart College Dolphins logo painted as a mural inside the Macartin Centre ",
    furtherText: `
    <p>This logo, which is the emblem for sports teams at Sacred Heart College, was devised by alumni Paul Swart (matric 1989) during his time at the school. Swart went on to become an architect after his time at Sacred Heart. 1989 was the first year that swimmers from Sacred Heart College swam the Midmar Mile (the world’s largest open water swim that takes place in February each year) coached by Veronica Sandham, then PE teacher, and the swimming team wanted something to put on their team T-shirts to mark this event. The dolphin was suggested by Franco Gilardi (alumnus and later PE teacher) and since the late 1980s has been particularly associated with Sacred Heart College’s swimmers and basketball players (though the emblem represents all school teams). The same logo is to be found on the flooring of the Macartin Centre as well as mosaicked onto the bottom of the swimming pool.  </p>
