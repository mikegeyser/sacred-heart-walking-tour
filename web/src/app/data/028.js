    furtherText: `
    <p>In 1980, when three Catholic educational foundations came together into one school, the school known colloquially as Marist Brothers’ Observatory reverted to its religious name, ‘Sacred Heart College’, which dated back to the late 1920s, but was rarely used.</p>
<p>The symbolism present in the three schools’ individual crests was incorporated into a new school badge and crest for Sacred Heart College. The stars from the Ursulines, the trefoil from the Holy Family and the Marist colours were combined into one badge. A more detailed account of the amalgamation of the three school crests can be read about in the slides that relate to the school’s uniform.  </p>

    <p>This article from the Rand Daily Mail gives some of the student perspectives on the merging of the three schools. Learners from both the Ursuline and Holy Family Convents, as well as many Sisters and their lay staff, came to Sacred Heart. </p>
<p>Brother Neil McGurk explained that the decision to become co-educational was not only a practical solution for the female pupils when the two Convent schools decided to close. It brought together the already intertwined educational heritages of the three congregations, but it also hinged around something deeper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For many of us the cultural context of the emerging South Africa required transforming the male hubris of the all-boys school, which had dominated much of the sporting and cultural activities of Sacred Heart College in the past. However, it was not a popular decision at the time with those traditionalists who had epitomised a good education for boys with such a hubris, which seemed to be required for success in the corridors of power in society. The girls did not disappoint. They brought a new human quality to the College’s social, cultural and spiritual life, and quickly rising to leadership roles, they assisted in re-defining the nature of those roles.”</p>

    <p>Founded by St Angela de Merici in the 1500s, The Ursuline Order of Sisters began as a group of women called to teach girls. This was long before formal education of girls was accepted as the norm. At first, the women lived with their own families but, as their mission became more focused on structured education and the provision of schools, it was decided that they would live together in religious communities where teaching could be done alongside communal prayer. Angela Merici chose St Ursula as the patron saint for the order as she prayed before an image of St Ursula in the church of San Francesco, Brescia (Italy). The first community was established at Brescia. Angela was deeply influenced by the legends surrounding Princess Ursula, a young woman whose faith in God was stronger than death, and who was martyred in the 3rd century along with a group of pious women. </p>
<p>A group of Dutch and British Ursuline Sisters arrived in South Africa in 1895 and settled in Barberton. By 1889 this town had collapsed as a mining centre. The Ursuline Sisters came to Johannesburg and took over a school in Braamfontein first established by the Holy Family Sisters; an early joint mission between congregations that were to reunite within Sacred Heart College one hundred years later. The Braamfontein school closed in 1907 and the Sisters transferred to Krugersdorp (later moving to Roodepoort and selling their site to the La Salle Brothers). Not long after their school was established in Krugersdorp they turned their farm land in Bezuidenhout Valley into the Convent School of St. Angela’s, which existed from 1914 until its merger with Sacred Heart in 1980. Another Ursuline school, Brescia House, was established in Bryanston in the 1960s, and still exists today. </p>

    <p>The Holy Family of Bordeaux is a Catholic congregation formed by Pierre-Beinvenu de Noailles in 1820. Three young girls came to the newly ordained priest for spiritual direction, inspiring him to establish a sisterhood inspired by imitation of the Holy Family (Mary, Joseph and Jesus) and devotion to the three-in-one Christian concept of the God as a Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The Sisterhood was to go on to have several branches, each with a special focus such as nursing, teaching and Christian mission.  </p>
<p>Holy Family Sisters were invited to Johannesburg by Fr Monginoux O.M.I. (who also invited the Marist Brothers to the city). They arrived in 1887 and established a convent school at End Street in Doornfontein, at the junction of Fox and Smal Streets. End Street was so named because at that time, in the 1880s, it formed the far eastern boundary of the city; the east ‘end’ of Johannesburg, with Fordsburg being the furthest settlement to the west. The Doornfontein area was entirely residential at the time. Boys from the Holy Family Convent were some of the first pupils to move over to the newly established boys’ school, Marist Brothers College at Koch Street, in 1889. Perhaps some of the boys in this picture were amongst those to attend Koch Street. </p>
<p>The Holy Family Sisters, from their beginnings in Johannesburg in the 1880s, flourished and set up several convent schools in the city. By the 1960s they had 100 Sisters, split between convents in Yeoville, Kensington, Victory Park, Parktown and Coronationville, and a further 140 Sisters in the rest of South Africa. The Holy Family Schools in Parktown and Coronationville remain today.  </p>

    <p>This image shows an example of some of the shared activities between the girls’ and boys’ schools, as the schools were single sex at that time. This also appears to have been a racially mixed congregation, indicating something of the inclusivity of the Marist and Holy Family Congregations in the early 1900s.</p>
<p>Holy Family Convent at Yeoville, which merged with Marist Brothers’ College, took boys until Standard 2 only. From Standard 3 most of those boys, including Brother Neil (later Principal of Sacred Heart), attended Marist Obs. Brother Neil and Beverly Fulton Blow, ballet teacher at Sacred Heart College from 1980-2016, were in the same junior primary classes together at Yeoville Convent. Some current staff and learners can trace family connections to one of the three schools that merged in 1980. </p>

    <p>Another example of the communal activities between learners of the three schools that later merged can be seen here in the performance of Ursuline girls in the hall at Koch Street in 1950. Not only were the Catholic congregations coming together, but this picture shows three yarmulke-wearing boys, representative of the high proportion of Jewish pupils at both Sacred Heart Colleges in Koch Street and at Observatory. For years, a Rabbi visited the College each week to give the Jewish boys religious instruction, until the numbers of Jewish boys on the roll dwindled to a level that rendered this service unnecessary. </p>
<p>At least three of the pictured girls went on to join the Sisterhood; Maureen Murray at the front right of the picture became Sister Veronica Murray who taught at the Ursuline School in Kensington and later became Headmistress of Brescia House from 1975-1980. </p>

    <p>“If mothers in the world had a thousand children, they would find a place for each one in their hearts,” wrote Sister Stella in the 1980 Sacred Heart College yearbook, echoing the words of St Angela, the foundress of the Ursuline Order. The message is similarly understood to that of Marcellin Champagnat’s “to teach children well you must first love them and love them equally”, and demonstrates the filial bond between the Catholic Orders that came together in the extended family of Sacred Heart College.</p>
<p>This statue of St Angela with a girl represents how the foundress of the Ursuline Sisters’ mission began when she gathered women to dedicate themselves to the teaching of girls, particularly impoverished girls, at a time when formal education for girls was unheard of. This statue came to Sacred Heart from the St. Angela’s Ursuline Convent in Kensington in 1980 and was first installed, after being re-painted in white, on one of the traffic islands in front of the College (as can be seen in this picture). At the Ursuline Convent, the statue was positioned in an alcove above an archway and this niche was, over time, colonised by honeybees. When the Chapel piazza was repaved in 1995, the statue of St Angela was moved to her current position between the Memorial Chapel and the main quad tunnel. It was at this time that the explanatory plaque under the statue was added. </p>
