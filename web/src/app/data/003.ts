    <p>After 1913 there were no more additions to the school buildings at Koch Street, despite the continuing growing number of boys on the roll and waiting list. With the spread of Johannesburg, a town not much older than Sacred Heart College itself, space was at a premium and the area surrounding Koch Street was entirely built up. Playground space was inadequate, and overspill at break-time as well as sports events were thus accommodated at the (Old) Wanderers Grounds, a few blocks away across the railway tracks. The Brothers decided that they needed new premises was necessary if they were to expand their teaching provisions alongside the growing city (though Johannesburg was only officially designated as a city in 1928). The First World War (1914-18) delayed the search for another property, but in 1919 the Brothers purchased 32 acres of land on Observatory Ridge, then outside Johannesburg. </p>

    <p>Building works at the Observatory site took a little over a year to complete. Not only did the school have to be built from scratch, but the ground had to be levelled and outcrops of granite and iron containing rocks blasted in order to lay the sports grounds that were sorely missed at Koch Street. The architect, Mr P.J. Hill, was a former Marist pupil, having been taught by the Brothers at Uitenhage. Much of the blasting was completed by Brother Henry, who took out a special licence in order to do so. The grounds were landscaped under the direction of Brother Florian, a keen botanist, who was to become the first Principal of the College. </p>
<p>The new school opened on 1 February 1926 in Observatory to approximately 250 pupils. The senior classes from Koch Street, from Standard 2 (Grade 4 today) to Matric, were moved to the new premises.</p>

    <p>Sacred Heart College, Koch Street became the preparatory school to Observatory. Brother Martin, Marist Archivist, noted that the Observatory school was originally to be the preparatory school, with Koch Street the senior school. This didn’t happen, perhaps due to the superior sports facilities at Observatory. In the early 1900s several other boys’ schools, like Johannesburg College (later renamed King Edward VII School (KES)), St. John’s and Jeppe High School for Boys were opened; it is likely that the seniors moved to Observatory so that they could compete with these schools in sport. Interestingly, the school name is given in this advertisement as Marist Brothers’ New College, while the original College name, as suggested in archival material, was St Benedict’s (to differentiate from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street). The name Sacred Heart College is recorded in documents from the 1930s, but Marist Brothers College or Marist ‘Obs’ (a shortened form of Observatory) were used colloquially until the 1980s.</p>

    <p>The first few years at Obs were years of expansion –  in terms of both buildings and pupil The first few years at Obs were years of expansion –  in terms of both buildings and pupil numbers. In this image you can just make out the Hall building to the right of the main building. Notable are the open upper walkways which lead from the northern and southern ends of the main building towards the central facade. These were later covered and used to extend the interior space on the upper level. One of the first ‘extras’ was the swimming pool, added in 1930. The school opened as a school for boys – white boys – with some Chinese pupils being admitted in the 1930s. Obs, like Sacred Heart at Koch Street, also offered boarding facilities. The number of pupils grew so quickly that a new wing was added in 1931, housing several classrooms, Chaplain’s quarters, a library, a sanatorium and a second dormitory. This is the building that today houses the Marist Provincial Offices and a number of classrooms, situated parallel to the Hall. </p>
<p>At the time of opening there were twelve teaching Brothers, assisted by several specialist lay-teachers, including alumnus Mr. W. Singleton who until then taught at Koch Street. Sources record that “the boys were full of admiration for the well – ventilated classrooms, the hall, the tennis-courts and the wide open spaces.”</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>At the bottom of this envelope ‘Marist Bros. Observatory, Joburg’ was added by the Post Office, identifying Obs as the ‘biggest school’ in the Transvaal. By 1932 Johannesburg was already by far the largest city in South Africa, and that Obs was recognised as the ‘Biggest School’ in the city speaks volumes about its then reputation. This reputation initially extended from that of its mother school in Koch Street, but in very little time Obs was to become the Marist ‘monument’ that it remains today. Some documents in the archives date the arrival of the letter as 1932, but others as 1952. In any case, a remarkable artefact.</p>
<p>By the mid 1930s the school numbers were close to 400 and a new classroom block was added (now part of the junior primary quad) as well as further sports facilities. The school was full to capacity. Koch Street was again oversubscribed, particularly (for both schools) the boarding facilities. By the early 1940s Obs had over 600 pupils and more primary-aged pupils were admitted to the school. Koch Street was thus not the only preparatory school, though it continued to take the very youngest Marist pupils. The Marist Brothers decided to purchase another site and in 1941 St. David’s Inanda was opened</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Though the expansions of the school buildings speak about the physical changes to the school in terms of pupil numbers and improvements to facilities, the transformations of the Sacred Heart community should rather be understood in terms of its socio-cultural developments. The school at Koch Street, whilst a Catholic school, welcomed pupils of different religious backgrounds. Its daughter school, Sacred Heart College Observatory, did the same. Jewish learners were supported by weekly instruction from a visiting Rabbi in the 1930s and 40s, while Catholic pupils were encouraged in Catechism and could belong to Sodalities (societies focused on faith). The South African Catholic Bishops Conference (SACBC), to whom the Marists belonged (and in the 1930s had hosted at Observatory) had long been publicly denouncing discriminatory policies. In 1975 the SACBC declared their position with regard to (racially integrated) Open Schooling and in 1976 the Soweto student uprisings brought to the fore this issue at home and internationally. In 1976 no school magazine was produced. By no means was this was to erase the significance of this year, but rather highlights a turning point in the history of the school. </p>
<p>Former Principal, Stephen Lowry, wrote in 2002:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From 1976 the school was led by Brother Neil McGurk who had an inspired vision of what education could be in the South Africa of 25 years ago. The Marist Brothers’ understanding of their mission led them to defy government decree and open the school to boys of all races. However the newcomers did not present a real challenge to the school… The real cultural revolution probably took place four years later when in 1980 girls were first admitted to the school when it amalgamated with two near-by convents. [At that time] “Marist Brothers’ – Observatory” reverted to its religious name, Sacred Heart College.”</p>

    <p>In 2017, Sacred Heart College serves approximately 1,200 learners from Pre-Primary to Matric plus 200 who attend the Three2Six school. The school provides a nurturing and dynamic learning environment supported by Marist educational principles; a representative and diverse microcosm of the positive possibilities of South African society. The school is proud of its heritage and whilst protective of its positive contributions, continues to innovate, leaving behind elements better bygone (as evidenced by its ‘changing face’). Colin Northmore prefaced the 2010 yearbook with this summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sacred Heart has always had a reputation for making bold decisions in curriculum innovation and when it comes to addressing the social evils of our time. Right back to the time when the Brothers turned the school into a hospital for the Boers and the Brits during the South African War, and created a situation where sworn enemies lay side by side recovering from the wounds they inflicted upon one another, our school has been a beacon of hope.”</p>
