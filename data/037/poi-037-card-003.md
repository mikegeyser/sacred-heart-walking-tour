The dining room would have seated 80-100 boys. Each table seated eight and was arranged with a Table Captain and Vice-Captain, who were senior boys appointed to be in charge of behaviour and the serving of food. Some recalled this system to have been less than democratic and the portions received reflective of this. Not unimaginable was the hierarchical system that it created and the likely disproportionate rationing of food between boys of different ages. E. Joffe’s memoir, “Before Mandela’s Rainbow”, reflected on the boarders’ delight at supplementing their meals from the dining room with offerings from the day boys’ packed lunches and with trips to the shops in Yeoville. Of course this latter possibility was only a privilege available to the older boys, who were able to leave the school grounds for such excursions.
