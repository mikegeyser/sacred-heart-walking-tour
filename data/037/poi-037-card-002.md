The food served in the Refectory was adjusted seasonally; a menu for summer and a menu for winter. Year round, as in most Christian (especially Catholic) institutions, fish was served on Fridays. During the war years of the 1930s-1940s when provisions were in shorter supply and budget was restricted the main staple was corned beef. The Chef created a variety of ways in which to serve it; curried, fried, minced with rice, cold with salad at lunch or hashed with potatoes. Eggs and porridge were served at breakfast.

The boarders were known for their fondness of adding a variety of condiments like piccalilli, tomato sauce, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce to their meals and for which there was a separate table that the boys could laden with their personal supplies. Though several of the Brothers, or Crows as they were known by the boys, were on duty in the Refectory at meal times, the rest ate in their own separate dining room (now this room is used as Habits, the Coffee Shop) – the interconnecting door between the two dining rooms is still functional. It isn’t clear whether the Brothers had their own menus or shared that of the boys.

In the archives menus from celebratory dinners exist – for example the Golden Jubilee Dinner of The Marist Old Boys’ Association held in 1951 consisted of ‘Spaghetti mince soufflé’ followed by ‘Fruit in jelly with custard’ and likely was a similar meal to that which was served while they were actual pupils at the school.
