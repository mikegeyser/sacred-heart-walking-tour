The food served in the Refectory was adjusted seasonally; a menu for summer and one for winter. Year round, as in most Christian (especially Catholic) institutions, fish was served on Fridays. During the war years (1930s-1940s), when provisions were in shorter supply and budget was restricted, the main staple was corned beef. The Chef served it curried, fried, minced with rice, cold with salad at lunch or hashed with potatoes. Eggs and porridge were served at breakfast.

The boarders were fond of condiments like piccalilli, tomato sauce, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce, and a separate table was laden with the boys' personal supplies. Though some Brothers (named Crows by the boys) were on duty in the Refectory at meal times, the rest ate in a separate dining room (now Habits, the Coffee Shop). The interconnecting door between the two dining rooms is still functional. The Brothers shared a menu with the boys, albeit with a few extras here and there.

The archive has menus from celebratory dinners, for example, the 1951 Golden Jubilee Dinner of the Marist Old Boys’ Association. ‘Spaghetti mince soufflé’ was followed by ‘Fruit in jelly with custard’ and likely similar to the meals they were served whilst still at school.
