The room known to learners and staff as the Pulse Media Centre, situated in the Marcia Hyam Library, started off as the Boarders’ Refectory (dining room) when the College opened in 1926\. One of the first Chefs at the college was Ephraim Letebele, who started at the school in 1934 and stayed until his retirement in 1974, coinciding with the end of the boarding at the College. His kitchen was situated behind the high school tuck-shop. Ephraim Letebele’s legacy at the school carries on today – his grandchildren and great-grandchildren have passed through the school as learners and his son, Joseph Letebele, who started as College Handyman in 1961 is an indispensable part of the Maintenance Staff. The Letebele Music Centre which was opened in 2002 was named for this family’s association with and contribution to Sacred Heart College.
