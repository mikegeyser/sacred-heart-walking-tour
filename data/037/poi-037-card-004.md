When the College first opened there was no stand-alone library. There was a small bookshelf available for the Boarders only which was found in the New Wing (added in 1931). In 1937 the City Council presented the school with an Oak bookcase (which can still be found today in the library) to celebrate the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth I. Day boys were not permitted to access these as well because of the lack of books and during the 1940s and 50s appeals were made by the P.T.A. (now P.A. and prior to 1960s The Ladiesâ€™ Association) for donations to grow the library which was managed by the Brothers.

By the 1960s, after the success of these appeals, all boys were allowed to use the lending library. In 1969 the amount of books necessitated an upgraded to the space and the school library was built (between the chapel and the Junior Primary Quad). When the Senior Primary (or Intermediate Quad) was added at the end of 1980s and the library was converted into classrooms for the junior pupils once the school roll had again increased, the Refectory (now defunct after there were no more boarders at the school) was turned into the Senior Library. The Primary School used, as still today, the purpose built library in the Intermediate Quad basement.
