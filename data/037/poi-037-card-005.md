Dr Marcia Hyam, neé Warmback, after whom the Library is named, and her two brothers had a long connection with the school. André and Patrick attended Yeoville Convent until Standard 3 when they moved to Marist ‘Obs’. André, a school Cadet member, joined the South African Air Force. In 1945 whilst flying a Lancaster Bomber, he went missing after a raid on Italy, presumed killed.

In 1938, aged 14 (Standard 9) at Yeoville Convent, Marcia had a part in the Sacred Heart College production of Abraham Lincoln, along with two other girls. Her Headmistress insisted that the girls were chaperoned to and from rehearsals at the College and asked for a few boys to do so. Records show that 66 boys volunteered their services!

Dr Marcia Hyam returned to Yeoville Convent to teach for 27 years. From 1980 she taught maths at Sacred Heart College, heading the Department for ten years, until her retirement and emigration to Australia in 1992. Dr Hyam played the piano and organ at school events and composed the music and lyrics for the school song. The 1992 Sacred Heart College yearbook recalls her incredible drive, her wrangles with College management, dedication to her students and her often used catchphrases, including: 

"Just because you are in maths, doesn't mean you only have to learn mathematics." 
"Mommy and Nanny didn't pack your calculator today."  
"Don't sit and wait for better days. They won't come. You must make them NOW!"
