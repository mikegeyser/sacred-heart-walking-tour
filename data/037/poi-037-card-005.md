Dr Marcia Hyam, neé Warmback, after whom the College Library is named, and her two brothers, André and Patrick, had a long and deep connection with the school. André and Patrick attended Yeoville Convent until Standard 3 when they moved to Sacred Heart at Observatory. André, a school Cadet member joined the forces fighting in the North African desert in the Second World War. Later, he became part of South African Air Force but after a raid on Italy in 1945 went missing whilst flying a Lancaster Bomber, presumed killed.

In 1938, aged 14 and in Standard 9, Marcia had a part in the Sacred Heart College production of Abraham Lincoln by John Drinkwater, along with two other girls from Yeoville Convent. The Headmistress of Yeoville Convent at the time insisted that the girls were chaperoned to and from rehearsals at the College and asked for the help of a few boys to do so. Records show that 66 boys volunteered their services!

Dr Marcia Hyam returned to her alma mater to teach for 27 years and from 1980 she taught at Sacred Heart College. She taught maths, heading up the Department for ten years until her retirement and emigration to Australia in 1992\. Dr Hyam also played the piano and organ at school events and composed the music and lyrics for the school song.

The 1992 Sacred Heart College yearbook recalls her incredible drive, her wrangles with College management and dedication to her students as well as her often used catchphrases, including:

"Now is the time, not tomorrow."  
"Don't sit and wait for better days. They won't come. You must make them NOW!"  
"Mommy and Nanny didn't pack your calculator today."  
"Just because you are in maths, doesn't mean you only have to learn mathematics."  
"Now go home to-day (with your hands on your eyes) and THINK for five minutes."  
"I can conquer the problems that conquered you in the test".
