In 2012 the Marcia Hyam Library was redesigned for 21st century learners. The design, including an AV room, a think tank that can be secluded with curtains, access to digital reference books and a reading zone were put together by Andr√© Croucamp of MindBurst; College parent Bea Roberts, and architect Nabeel Essa. The centre was named Pulse after a workshop with learners at the school and reflects its essence, heart, connectedness and sensitivity to world rhythms and dynamics. 

The funding for the new centre was provided by Zwelakhe Sisulu (who died three weeks before the centre opened) and the Friends of Eric Molobi, reflecting the mutual association of these struggle activists and the College; connected in their personal narratives but also through their dedication to freedom of information, access to education and the fight for social justice. The Sisulu and Molobi families both have long and involved relations with the school from the 1960s, which continue to this day.
