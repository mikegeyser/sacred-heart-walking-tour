In 2012 the Marcia Hyam Library was redesigned for 21st Century leaners at the College. The designs which include an AV room, a think tank that can be secluded with curtains, access to digital reference books and a reading zone were put together by André Croucamp founder of Critical Thinking education provider MindBurst; writer, researcher, editor and College parent Bea Roberts, and architect Nabeel Essa. The centre was named Pulse in collaboration with Croucamp and Roberts after a workshop with learners at the school and reflects its essence, heart, connectedness and sensitivity to world rhythms and dynamics.

As is reflective of the innovative and progressive teaching and learning at Sacred Heart, the librarians are learners who support the teachers rather than the other way around, and echoes Eric Molobi and the Robben Island Prisoners motto “Each One Teach One”. The funding for the new centre was provided by Zwelakhe Sisulu (who died three weeks before the centre opened) and the Friends of Eric Molobi, reflecting the mutual association of these struggle activists and the College connected in their personal narratives but also through their dedication to freedom of information, access to education and the fight for social justice. The Sisulu and Molobi families both have long and involved relations with the school, from the 1960s, which continue to this day.
