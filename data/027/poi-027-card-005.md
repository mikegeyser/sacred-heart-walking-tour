Rugby was popular with the boys and an important feature of College life for years – games drew large crowds with major opponents being St. David’s, Inanda, Jeppe Boys’ High School, Parktown Boys and K.E.S.  However, no match was more popular than the annual Boarders v. Day Boys fixture (providing the boys with an opportunity to create their own traditions e.g. junior boys rolling out red carpets for the senior players) which set the tone of the spirit of the school at the time. Brother Mario remembers the Rugby games in the ‘60s and ‘70s being more like clashes than matches and the War Cry being belted out with more than just volume. 

Rugby was played at the school until 1986 when the sport was re-replaced by Soccer. There were several reasons for this; the admission of black students in the 1970s embodied the College’s distancing from the then Government’s elitist policies, for many Rugby symbolized these colonial hangovers. With the school now co-educational, the hubristic and ‘putting-on-a-pedestal’ tendencies that the sport engendered were no longer appropriate. Many of the boys at the school were also inspired towards Soccer by one of their teachers, Mickey Lill a former English Premier League player. The tragic death of alumnus Jeffrey Ho on the field, playing for an Old Boys’ team in 1984, hastened the end of rugby, though this had been coming for some years. A plaque dedicated to the memory of Jeffrey Ho can be found set into the wall by the steps that lead up to the former rugby pitches (now the First Soccer field) directly east of the Science Block.
