Rugby was played at Koch Street until a few years before WW1. A Koch Street team won the 1899 Transvaal Rugby Junior Cup, captained by Woodburn MacCowat (who later played for Scotland), against Pirates. Then the boys played Rugby League code (13 players per team). But the Brothers College chose to concentrate on soccer so rugby was ‘discontinued’. Writing in the 1912 Maristonian, Clarence Becker (a Koch Street alumnus), later national selector for the S.A Rugby Association, took the Brothers to task for having "cold-shouldered" rugby. Brother Valerian, then Principal, explained that " rugger will always be a risky game . . . There is no gainsaying that rugger is a grand game . . . but where small and big boys are so mixed up in the classes . . . we cannot be convinced that rugger is a better game for growing lads than soccer . . .” 
 
Rugby was reintroduced to Sacred Heart College in 1934 as the official winter sport, in line with the Transvaal schools’ sports policy. The Transvaal Rugby Union grassed the old soccer pitches and the school adopted the Rugby Union code (playing with 15 players). The boys were coached by professionals and the Brothers. In 1949 the New Zealand All Blacks (whose team had nine Marist Old Boys in) visited the college and presented the 1st XV with an inscribed ball. More than the equivalent of a whole rugby team of Springbok players were introduced to the sport at Sacred Heart including Syd Nomis (1st XV player in 1958), who until 2001 held the record for most consecutive games played (25) for the Springboks.
