This Silver medal, which measures about 4cm x 4 cm was awarded to A. Tully in 1900. It was 
donated by Alec Kaplan and Son (Pty) Ltd to Museum Africa in 1979. Not only have sports themselves evolved over the years at Sacred Heart College, so too have the individual awards. Today 3rd place in 100 meters would be awarded a certificate and ribbon.
