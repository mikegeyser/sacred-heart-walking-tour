The open veld of Observatory provided the Brothers with the opportunity to not only build a new school but to create expansive playing fields for sports that would have been impossible in the residential suburb of Doornfontein. The purchase of 32 acres on Observatory Ridge meant that the sporting reputation of Sacred Heart College, Koch Street could be maintained and, as history proved, built upon. An article in The Star published in 1965 described the Koch Street school as “a famous sporting nursery” and a “soccer stronghold…[that]… over the years, athletes, cricketers, rugby internationals and tennis players owed both their own greatness, and the splendour they gave to South African sport, to their training at Marists.”

The top field was levelled during the late 1920s as it was a rocky waste land. During the 1960s, the fields were given their two-tiered layout. Soil, excavated from Rosebank while building the Mall, was used to raise the topmost fields and thereby create a sunken cricket oval. 

Several sports have fallen out of the curriculum at the College over the years, for a variety of different reasons, and other sports have been added as time goes on.
