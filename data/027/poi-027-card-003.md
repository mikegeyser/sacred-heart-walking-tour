The lightweight school Boxers were known as the College Midgets with the Mighty Midgets (or Marist Midgets) being the title that went to the Senior or Heavyweight boys. The college boxing trainer and manager for several decades was Jack O’Malley. Des Williams represented South Africa in the 1948 Olympic Games as a flyweight was one of O’Malley’s first trainees. Indeed, the 1965 Maristonian lists eight alumni as having represented the country in boxing with one (J. Watson) becoming South African Boxing coach. Stan Silcock also learnt boxing under Jack O’Malley and later became headmaster of Marian College, Linmeyer.
