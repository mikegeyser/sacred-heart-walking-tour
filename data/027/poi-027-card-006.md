Some sports can go in and out of ‘fashion’ and specialist teachers might come and go. Fencing, Judo and Baseball are two examples of this. Better known for its Rugby Club today, Pirates also started a Baseball League when many Americans arrived to join the mining camps in the late 1880s, in the 1950s it was Baseball that carried the Pirates reputation around South Africa – not Rugby. Sacred Heart College had their own team that participated in its tournaments.
