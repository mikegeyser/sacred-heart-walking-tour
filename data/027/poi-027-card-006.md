Many curriculum and club sports have been and gone at Sacred Heart College. Reasons for this include differing levels of interest at different times by the boys – sports can go in and out of ‘fashion’ and specialist teachers come and go. Fencing, judo and baseball are examples of this tendency. Better known for its rugby club today, Pirates started a baseball league when many Americans arrived to join the mining camps in the late 1880s. In the 1950s it was baseball that carried the Pirates’ reputation around South Africa – not rugby. Sacred Heart College had its own team that participated in its tournaments.
