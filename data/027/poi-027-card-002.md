Boxing was a very popular sport until the late 1950s. A ring, donated in the 1930s by the S.A.N.A.B.A (South African National Amateur Boxing Association), was set up in the Hall for practices and for years Sacred Heart College was the only school in Johannesburg with an actual ring. The boys took part in tournaments against pugilists from other schools and against each other â€“ from the mid 1940s the Boarders vs. Day Boys boxing tournament was an annual calendar highlight. The boxing ring was even set up in the Main Quad for the annual school championships since the sport was popular with spectators, and the crowd drawn to the event was too large to fit in the Hall.
