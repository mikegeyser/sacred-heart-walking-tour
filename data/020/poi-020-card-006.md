Both the Primary and High Schools have several musical ensembles, including the seniors’ One Heart Choir, String and Woodwind Ensemble, The Sacred Heart Jazz band and a number of Marimba groups (including the featured Iyon Brew). As well as players of more traditional instruments there are a growing number of contemporary musicians and vocalists who refine their skills at school. 

With a burgeoning and reinvigorated music scene at the school it is fitting that The One Heart Music Festival, annual hot ticket during the City of Johannesburg’s Heritage Day celebrations, showcases the combined talents of performers from Sacred Heart and other Marist schools alongside those more well known (both at home and abroad) such as Sipho ‘Hotstix’ Mabuse, Feya Faku, Judith Sephuma, MiCasa, Lira and Black Coffee. The Festival, which developed out of the Sacred Heart Cultural Festival and School Fête, raises awareness around xenophobia amidst the celebration of national heritages, with proceeds from tickets going towards funding the Three2Six school and, in recent years, the Field of Flowers (a scholarship fund enabling children from disadvantaged backgrounds to study at Sacred Heart College).
