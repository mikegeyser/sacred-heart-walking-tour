The Letebele Music Centre was opened in 2002 by Joseph Letebele and named for the familyâ€™s long history with and worthy contributions to the school community. The centre, which was converted from staff accommodation to a music block at the turn of the millenium to a music block contained one large teaching classroom and twelve small rooms for musical tuition and practice. 

Today this space is no longer adequate for the needs of the Sacred Heart learners and funds are currently being raised for a new M.A.D Centre (Music, Arts and Drama Centre), which will allow music and arts to grow and flourish at Sacred Heart. Architectural plans have been drawn up for this new facility on the site of the existing sports kiosk.
