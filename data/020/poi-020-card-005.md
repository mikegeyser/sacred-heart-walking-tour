The Letebele Music Centre was opened in 2002 by Joseph Letebele and named for the familyâ€™s long history with and worthy contributions to the school community. The centre, which was converted from staff accommodation at the turn of the millenium to a music block contained one large teaching classroom and twelve small rooms for musical tuition and practice. 

Today this space set aside for musical learning has become inadequate for the needs of the learners at Sacred Heart and so a new M.A.D Centre (Music, Arts and Drama Centre) is currently being fundraised for. Architectural plans have been drawn up and soon construction should begin for this new facility on the site of the existing kiosk in the sports fields. This should allow for the prodigious talents of the school learners in the arts to continue to grow and flourish further.
