The four existing members of the Sacred Heart Jazz Band, Riley Pam-Grant, Paul Stansell, Jeremy Crouch and Howard Su, were joined in 2016 by vocalists Lerato Dieterich, Angel Gwanda and Lethabo Sephuma. During an intense 2016, packed with rehearsals and workshops, Thangzz were finalists in both the "Battle of the Bands" at St Mary's and the St Andrew's "Viebz contemporary music" competitions. Thangzz also performed, and wowed, the general public at Jazz on the Lawn in Cape Town (March 2016) and at the One Heart Music Festival in Johannesburg (September 2016).
