The Marching Band at Sacred Heart College held a very special position within the school’s history – from the Koch Street days and throughout many years at Observatory. Starting off as The Marching Band that led Cadet Corps displays, even after the Cadet’s dissolution, the band ‘marched on’ leading learners to athletics meetings and swimming galas. It is because of this tradition that a ‘march on’ is still the format in which the school progresses to the top fields to take part in the annual inter-house athletics meeting in September but now music is played through the loudspeaker system rather than accompanied with an actual band.
