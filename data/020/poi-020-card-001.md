The phonograph was invented by Thomas Edison (also the inventor of the lightbulb) in 1877\. It was the first machine on which sound could be recorded and reproduced on a prototype ‘record’. The phonograph evolved to become the gramophone and then the record player –the precursor to cassettes, CDs and downloadable music files. Some DJs however still prefer the sound quality of vinyl or ‘records’ on which to play their sets. The first of these machines arrived in Johannesburg in the 1890s and the Brothers saw to acquire one for the school.

In this picture an early phonograph machine is set on the table with several sets of earphones (though these were more like medical stethoscopes!) attached. The Brothers ran a fundraising scheme for the school with the boys paying three-pence each to listen to the recording – either music or special listings. The Brothers also recorded the names of boys who had attained good results or deserved special mention for particular activities and these names were listed and played during assemblies (for the phonograph could also be played with a horn like attachment which acted as a kind of loudspeaker).
