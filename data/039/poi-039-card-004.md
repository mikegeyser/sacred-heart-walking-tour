This statue of Mary is positioned to the left, just before the chancel in the Memorial Chapel, just as it was in the original chapel. Likewise, the statue of Joseph can be found to the right, just before the chancel in the Memorial Chapel.

The statue of Jesus with the Sacred Heart is not in the Memorial Chapel, its position has been replaced with a statue of Champagnat. However, the statue of Jesus moved from the original chapel has been mounted in a similar lofty position in the Pre-Primary reception area.

The stations of the cross were all moved from the old chapel and repositioned on the Memorial Chapel interior walls.
