The Chapel was dedicated to St Benedict with a ceremony that began in the College Chapel and continued elsewhere around the College buildings. This blessing was carried out on 28th January 1926 by the Right Rev. Bishop David O’Leary, just days before the boys arrived to begin the first ever academic year at the new Marist school in Observatory. Special rites were performed and prayers said at various points around the school, particularly at the main entrance. The ceremony also marked the naming of the school – originally to be called St Benedict’s - for senior Marist pupils, to differentiate from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street where the junior pupils remained.

The Chapel was fitted with wooden pews, an altar rail, several statues and 14 Stations of the Cross (five are visible here).
