The original Chapel was converted for other uses after the Memorial Chapel was dedicated in 1956, primarily becoming the place for catechism lessons. The space, known as the Old Chapel Theatre, continues to be repurposed and is now mainly used for arts-related teaching and performances, exhibitions, PR events and hospitality. A stage was built into the chancel area and the lighting changed to suit its new uses. The original fixtures, apart from the ceiling, were removed and redistributed around the school, mainly to the Memorial Chapel.
