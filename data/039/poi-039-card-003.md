This picture shows the Chapel dressed for its special visitor, Br Leonida, with fresh floral displays and a carpet running down the aisle. The reredos (the screen behind the Altar) is clearly visible with a statue of Jesus with Sacred Heart fixed atop in the chancel (the area set apart for Altar from main Chapel). Statues of Mary (on the left before the chancel) and Joseph (on the right before the chancel) as well as three of the fourteen Stations of the Cross are also visible.
