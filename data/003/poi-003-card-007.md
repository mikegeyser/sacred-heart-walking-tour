Though the expansions of the school buildings speak about the physical changes to the school in terms of pupil numbers and improvements to facilities, the transformations of the Sacred Heart community should rather be understood in terms of its socio-cultural developments. The school at Koch Street, whilst a Catholic school, welcomed pupils of different religious backgrounds. Its daughter school, Sacred Heart College Observatory, did the same. Jewish learners were supported by weekly instruction from a visiting Rabbi in the 1930s and 40s, while Catholic pupils were encouraged in Catechism and could belong to Sodalities (societies focused on faith). The South African Catholic Bishops Conference (SACBC), to whom the Marists belonged (and in the 1930s had hosted at Observatory) had long been publicly denouncing discriminatory policies. In 1975 the SACBC declared their position with regard to (racially integrated) Open Schooling and in 1976 the Soweto student uprisings brought to the fore this issue at home and internationally. In 1976 no school magazine was produced. By no means was this was to erase the significance of this year, but rather highlights a turning point in the history of the school. Between 1976 and 1980 the school became open to all races, and co-educational. 

Former Principal, Steven Lowry, wrote in 2002:
> “From 1976 the school was led by Brother Neil McGurk who had an inspired vision of what education could be in the South Africa of 25 years ago. The Marist Brothers’ understanding of their mission led them to defy government decree and open the school to boys of all races. However the newcomers did not present a real challenge to the school… The real cultural revolution probably took place four years later when in 1980 girls were first admitted to the school when it amalgamated with two near-by convents. [At that time] “Marist Brothers’ – Observatory” reverted to its religious name, Sacred Heart College.”
