Sacred Heart College at Koch Street became the preparatory school to Observatory. Brother Martin, Marist Archivist, noted that the Observatory school was originally to be the preparatory school, with Koch Street the senior school. This didn’t happen, perhaps due to the superior sports facilities at Observatory. The early 1900s saw the establishment of several other boys’ schools like Johannesburg College (later renamed King Edward VII School (KES), St. John’s and Jeppe High School for Boys; it is likely that the seniors moved to Observatory so that they could compete with these schools in sport. Interestingly, the school name is given in this advertisement as Marist Brothers’ New College, while the original College name, as suggested in archival material, was St Benedict’s (to differentiate from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street). The name Sacred Heart College is recorded in documents from the 1930s, but Marist Brothers College or Marist ‘Obs’ (a shortened form of Observatory) were used colloquially until the 1980s.
