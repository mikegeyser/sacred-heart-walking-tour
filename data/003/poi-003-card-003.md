Sacred Heart College at Koch Street became the preparatory school to Observatory. Brother Martin, Marist Archivist, noted that the Observatory school was to be the preparatory school, with Koch Street the senior school; this we know didn’t happen, perhaps due to the superior sporting facilities at Observatory being preferred for senior boys. The early 1900s saw several other boys’ schools open like Johannesburg College (later renamed King Edward VII School (K.E.S), St. John’s and Jeppe High School for Boys; it was likely that in order to compete with these schools on a sporting level the decision was reversed. Interestingly, the school name is not given in this advertisement – only Marist Brothers’ New College. The original College name as suggested in archival material, was St Benedict’s (to differentiate from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street). The name Sacred Heart College is recorded in documents from the 1930s, but Marist Brothers College or Marist ‘Obs’ (a shortened form of Observatory) were used colloquially until the 1980s.
