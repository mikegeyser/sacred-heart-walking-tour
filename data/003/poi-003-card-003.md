The first few years at Obs were years of expansion – in terms of both buildings and pupil numbers. In this image you can just make out the Hall building to the right of the main building. One of the first ‘extras’ was the swimming pool added in 1930\. The school opened as a school for boys – white boys – with some Chinese pupils being admitted in the 1930s. Obs, like Sacred Heart at Koch Street, also offered boarding facilities. The number of pupils grew so quickly that a new wing was added in 1931 which added several classrooms, Chaplain’s quarters, a library, a sanatorium and a second dormitory. This is the building that today houses the Marist Provincial Offices and a number of classrooms, situated parallel to the Hall.
