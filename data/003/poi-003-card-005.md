At the bottom of this envelope ‘Marist Bros. Observatory, Joburg’ was added by the Post Office, identifying Obs as the ‘biggest school’ in the Transvaal. By 1932 Johannesburg was already by far the largest city in South Africa, and that Obs was recognised as the ‘Biggest School’ in the city speaks volumes about its then reputation. This reputation initially extended from that of its mother school in Koch Street, but in very little time Obs was to become the Marist ‘monument’ that it remains today. Some documents in the archives date the arrival of the letter as 1932, but others as 1952. In any case, a remarkable artefact.
 
By the mid 1930s the school numbers were close to 400 and a new classroom block was added (now part of the junior primary quad) as well as further sports facilities. The school was full to capacity. Koch Street was again oversubscribed, particularly (for both schools) the boarding facilities. By the early 1940s Obs had over 600 pupils and more primary-aged pupils were admitted to the school. Koch Street was thus not the only preparatory school, though it continued to take the very youngest Marist pupils. The Marist Brothers decided to purchase another site and in 1941 St. David’s Inanda was opened
