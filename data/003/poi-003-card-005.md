Though the expansions of the school buildings speak about the physical changes of the school terms of pupil numbers and improvements to facilities, the transformations of the Sacred Heart community should rather be understood in terms of its socio-cultural developments. Just as the school at Koch Street, whilst a Catholic school, admitted pupils of different religious backgrounds its daughter school, Sacred Heart College Observatory, did the same. In the 1930s and 40s the Jewish learners were supported by weekly instruction from a visiting Rabbi. Catholic pupils were encouraged by lessons in Catechism and offered opportunities to belong to religious sodalities (societies focused on faith, in particular as in keeping with the Marist ethos, in the way of Mary). The South African Catholic Bishops Conference (SACBC), to whom the Marists belonged (and in the 1930s had hosted at Observatory) had been publically denouncing discriminatory policies. In 1975 the SACBC declared their position around Open Schooling (racially integrated) and not long after the Soweto uprising brought to the fore this issue at home and internationally.

In 1976 no school magazine was produced. By no means was this was to erase the significance of this year but rather highlights the year as a new starting point in the history of the school. The years between 1976-1980 saw the school become Open and Co-Educational.

Former Principal, Steven Lowry, wrote in 2002:

> “From 1976 the school was led by Brother Neil McGurk who had an inspired vision of what education could be in the South Africa of 25 years ago. The Marist Brothers’ understanding of their mission led them to defy government decree and open the school to boys of all races. However the newcomers did not present a real challenge to the school… The real cultural revolution probably took place four years later when in 1980 girls were first admitted to the school when it amalgamated with two near-by convents. “Marist Brothers’ – Observatory” reverted to its religious name, Sacred Heart College”.”
