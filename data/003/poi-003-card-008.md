In 2017, Sacred Heart College serves approx. 1,200 learners from Pre-Primary to Matric plus 200 who attend the Three2Six school. The school provides a nurturing and dynamic learning environment supported by Marist educational principles; a representative and diverse microcosm of the positive possibilities of South African society. The school is proud of its heritage and whilst protective of its positive contributions, continues to innovate, leaving behind elements better bygone (as evidenced by its ‘changing face’). Colin Northmore prefaced the 2010 yearbook with this summary of the unique character of the college:

> “Sacred Heart has always had a reputation for making bold decisions in curriculum innovation and when it comes to addressing the social evils of our time. Right back to the time when the Brothers turned the school into a hospital for the Boers and the Brits during the South African War, and created a situation where sworn enemies lay side by side recovering from the wounds they inflicted upon one another, our school been a beacon of hope.”
