After 1913 there were no more additions to the school buildings Koch Street, despite the continuing growing number of boys on the roll and waiting lists for places. With the spread of Johannesburg, a town not much older than Sacred Heart College itself, space was at a premium and no more existed at Koch Street or in its direct surrounds. Sporting events (and overspill at break-time for even the playground space was inadequate) were held at the (Old) Wanderers Grounds, a few blocks walk away and across the railway tracks. The Brothers decided then that another premises was necessary if they were to continue to expand their teaching provisions alongside the growing city (though Johannesburg was only officially designated as a city in 1928). The First World War (1914-18) delayed focus on the search for another property but in 1919 32 acres of land on Observatory ridge, then outside Johannesburg, were purchased by the Brothers.
