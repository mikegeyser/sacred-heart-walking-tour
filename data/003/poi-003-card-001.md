After 1913 there were no more additions to the school buildings at Koch Street, despite the continuing growing number of boys on the roll and waiting list. With the spread of Johannesburg, a town not much older than Sacred Heart College itself, space was at a premium and the area surrounding Koch Street was entirely built up. Playground space was inadequate, and overspill at break-time as well as sports events were thus accommodated at the (Old) Wanderers Grounds, a few blocks away across the railway tracks. The Brothers decided that they needed new premises was necessary if they were to expand their teaching provisions alongside the growing city (though Johannesburg was only officially designated as a city in 1928). The First World War (1914-18) delayed the search for another property, but in 1919 the Brothers purchased 32 acres of land on Observatory Ridge, then outside Johannesburg.
