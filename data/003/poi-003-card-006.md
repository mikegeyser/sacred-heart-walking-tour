Today, in 2017, Sacred Heart College serves approx. 1,200 learners from pre-primary to grade 12\. In addition, there are about 200 children who attend the Three2Six school that use the college facilities daily. The school provides a nurturing and dynamic learning environment still very much adhering to Marist educational principles as well as providing a more representative and diverse sanctuary as a microcosm of the positive possibilities of South African society. The school is conscious of its heritage and whilst proud and protective of its positive contributions also manages to push forward with innovations that sometimes leave these behind for the better (as evidenced by its ‘changing face’).

Colin Northmore prefaced the 2010 yearbook with this summary of the unique character of the college:

> “It may seem to be an obvious truth to say that the future of our country is dependent on our education system. Just as obvious…in this context, it is not difficult to clearly discern the role of an independent school such as ours. Sacred Heart has always had a reputation for making bold decisions in curriculum innovation and when it comes to addressing the social evils of our time. Right back to the time when the Brothers turned the school into a hospital for the Boers and the Brits during the South African War, and created a situation where sworn enemies lay side by side recovering from the wounds they inflicted upon one another, our school been a beacon of hope.”
