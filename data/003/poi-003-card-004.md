The additional text which reads ‘Marist Bros. Observatory, Joburg’ was added by the Post Office who had identified Obs as the ‘biggest school’ in the Transvaal – by 1932 Johannesburg was already by far the largest city in South Africa. That Obs was recognised as the ‘Biggest School’ in the city speaks volumes about its then reputation. This reputation initially extended from that of its mother school in Koch Street but in very little time Obs was to become the Marist ‘monument’ that it remains today.

By the mid 1930s the school numbers were close to 400 and a new classroom block was added (now part of the junior primary quad) and further sporting facilities added. The school was full to capacity and Koch Street was by now again oversubscribed, particularly for both schools in the boarding departments. By the early 1940s Obs had over 600 pupils and more primary aged pupils were admitted to the school (meaning that Koch Street was not the only preparatory school, though it continued to take the very youngest Marist pupils). The Marist Brothers sought to acquire another site and in 1941 St. David’s Inanda was opened.
