The new school opened on 1st February 1926 in Observatory to approximately 250 pupils - the senior classes, from Standard II (Grade 4 today) to Matric, from Koch Street were moved to the new premises. At first this was met with some resentment for it was felt by many that the new site was too far out of town to be easily accessed. Sacred Heart College at Koch Street then became the preparatory school to Observatory. Brother Martin however suggested that an early idea was that the Observatory school would be set up as the preparatory school, with Koch Street as the senior school; this we know didn’t happen and perhaps was due to the superior sporting facilities at Observatory being preferred for the older boys. The early 1900s saw several other boys’ schools open Johannesburg College (later renamed as King Edward VII School (K.E.S) St. John’s and Jeppe High School for Boys and it was likely that in order to compete with these schools on a sporting level the decision was reversed.

At the time of opening there were 12 teaching Brothers assisted by several specialist lay-teachers including alumni Mr. W. Singleton who had up until then taught at Koch Street. Sources record that “the boys were full of admiration for the well – ventilated classrooms, the hall, the tennis-courts and the wide open spaces.”

Interestingly the school name is not given in this advertisement – other than Marist Brothers’ New College. The original name for the school, as suggested in archival material, was St Benedict’s (to differentiate from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street). Though this name was later changed to Sacred Heart Col¬lege and is recorded as such in documents from the 1930s, the names Marist Brothers College or Marist ‘Obs’ (as a shortened form of Observatory) was used colloquially until the 1980s.
