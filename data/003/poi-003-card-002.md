Building works at the Observatory site took a little over a year to complete. Not only did the school have to be built from scratch, but the ground had to be levelled and outcrops of granite and iron containing rocks blasted in order to lay the sports grounds that were sorely missed at Koch Street. The architect, Mr P.J. Hill, was a former Marist pupil, having been taught by the Brothers at Uitenhage. Much of the blasting was completed by Brother Henry, who took out a special licence in order to do so. The grounds were landscaped under the direction of Brother Florian, a keen botanist, who was to become the first Principal of the College. 

The new school opened on 1 February 1926 in Observatory to approximately 250 pupils. The senior classes from Koch Street, from Standard 2 (Grade 4 today) to Matric, were moved to the new premises.
