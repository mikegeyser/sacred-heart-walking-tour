Building works at the Observatory site took a little over a year to complete; not only did the school need to be built from scratch but the ground needed to be levelled and outcrops of granite and iron containing rocks needed to be blasted to lay the sports grounds that were sorely missed at Koch Street. The architect, Mr P.J. Hill was a former Marist pupil, having been taught by the Brothers at Uitenhage. Much of the blasting was completed by Brother Henry who took out a special licence in order to do so and the grounds were landscaped under the direction of Brother Florian, a keen botanist, who was to become the first Principal of the College. 

The new school opened on 1st February 1926 in Observatory to approximately 250 pupils - the senior classes, from Standard II (Grade 4 today) to Matric, from Koch Street were moved to the new premises.
