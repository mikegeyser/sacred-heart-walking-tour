However, in December 2016, Ntate Sammy said he wasn’t sure if he could retire… ‘as long as these gates are open and I can cycle through them I will want to’ … Indeed, Uncle Sammy can still be found (in 2017 at least) after school with his pushbike and freezer selling his ice creams to learners, parents and staff alike. In the same conversation Uncle Sammy said “My name isn’t really Uncle Sammy but one of the boys called me that a long time ago and it just stayed so now I am Uncle Sammy.”
