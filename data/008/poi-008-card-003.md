Usually to be found in The Orchard where the After Care operates, if the weather is bad Uncle Sammy can be found with his ice-cream cart (from which he also sells popcorn, chips and suckers for those not after ice-cream) in one of the quads. 

The 2003 Sacred Heart College yearbook captioned a photograph of Ntate Sammy in one of the quads with:
>  “What would our learners do without Sammy? For over forty years, Sammy has been part of Sacred Heart College. He has always been an honest businessman and goes out of his way to sort out “I’m a few cents short Sammy”.”
