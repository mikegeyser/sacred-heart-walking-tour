Before Uncle Sammy arrives at Sacred Heart, usually at around 2.30 (until after 5pm on a hot day â€¦ good for sales!), he stops at the gates of King Edward VII school where he also sells to the boys who attend there.  Therefore, Uncle Sammy is part of the fabric of the wider local community as well as being a familiar figure at Sacred Heart College. A quick scan of the school and alumni Facebook pages confirms this through the many posts and comments that fondly recall his presence (and presents!).
