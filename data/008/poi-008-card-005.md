Usually to be found in the Orchard during Aftercare, if the weather is bad Uncle Sammy takes his ice-cream cart (from which he also sells popcorn, chips and suckers for those not after ice-cream) into one of the quads. 

As well as coming daily during the school week, Uncle Sammy is a fixture at school sports or other events such as the Heritage Day Music Festival.
