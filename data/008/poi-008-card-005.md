Usually to be found in The Orchard where the After Care operates, if the weather is bad Uncle Sammy can be found with his ice-cream cart (from which he also sells popcorn, chips and suckers for those not after ice-cream) in one of the quads. 

As well as coming daily during the school week, Uncle Sammy is a fixture at other school sporting or other events such as the Heritage Day Music Festival.
