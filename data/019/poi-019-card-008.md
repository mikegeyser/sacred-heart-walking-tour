Until the disbanding of the Cadets there was an Armoury at the school. The Armoury at Obs contained Cadet kit (including uniform, drums, bugles and other band instruments) as well as relics from the South African War and the First and Second World Wars, such as .303 (which no longer worked) and .22 calibre rifles. The school shooting range, paid for by the South African military authorities in the 1920s, was situated in the far corner of the school grounds where the cricket nets are found today. When the Koch Street premises were demolished, used ammunition was found embedded in the walls, left over from when shooting practice took place in the school yard. It would not be impossible to find similar debris buried where cricket balls land in Observatory today. The former Armouryâ€™s cache of weapons has been replaced with a very different kind of battery cluster, as today it is used as the Primary School Computer Centre.
