The late Captain Roy’s sword was presented to the College Cadet Corps by his sister Edith Pooley in 1935 along with other memorabilia kept by Captain Roy such as photo albums of cadet camps, badges and some documents. The sword, embossed with an inscription that reads ‘Marist Bros Cadet Corps’, is still in the possession of the school. The sword made of solid silver, wood and leather is about 105 cm in length and has an intricately carved handle depicting the monogram of King Edward VII (dating the sword to the early 1900s), the monarch who reorganised the British Forces after the Anglo-Boer War, including the company to which the Marist Cadet Corps was affiliated. The blade (81cm) is still protected by its original leather scabbard.
