Such was the standing of the Marist Cadet Corps that it was regularly invited to perform in official state duties. In 1931 General F. Theron came to inspect the Cadets at Observatory, a photo of which appeared in the Rand Daily Mail. In this photograph is Staff Sergent Belcher (2nd right in back row), who matriculated in 1924 from Koch Street and continued to help the Marist community, with the Cadets (at Observatory) and coaching cricket (at Koch Street) and it was he who donated this image to Museum Africa.  In 1947 school cadet corps lined Louis Botha Avenue (then the main road in and out of Johannesburg) to stand to attention in honour of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (and the Princesses, one now Queen Elizabeth II) whose Rolls Royce drove past en route to Pretoria.
