In 1903 the Marist Cadet Corps was reformed and in 1904 they received official recognition from the Government and South African Military. This was in part due to the efforts of many military enthusiasts amongst the Old Boys, who had formed their own association in 1902. The Cadet Corps was gazetted and several officers from the South African Military got involved, all of whom, except Max Langerman, were alumni of Koch Street: Lieutenant-Colonel Max Langerman, Captain G. Hartog, Captain R. Goldberg, Captain G. H. Roy who was Adjutant and thus most senior in rank, Lieutenant F. Ingle, Lieutenant L. Lewison and Lieutenant W. McDonald. They were responsible for the training of the student and staff Officer Body, oversaw drills and displays, and prepared them for competitions. The Corps gained a reputation in particular for producing excellent marksmen, and had their own Reed and Brass Bands
