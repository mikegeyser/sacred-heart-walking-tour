By the 1930s the Cadet Corps had grown so large that the detachment had three full companies; Infantry Troops (the backbone of the Corps), a Platoon of Signaleers (responsible for military communications) and a Platoon trained in Trench Mortar and Bren Gun deployment (specialising in weaponry). The Cadet Band, now a mixed orchestral marching band, was a regularly anticipated feature of school pageants and until only recently did the College Band, ‘March On,’ leading participants to sporting events.
