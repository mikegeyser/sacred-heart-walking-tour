By the 1930s the Cadet Corps had grown so large that the detachment had three full companies; Infantry Troops (the backbone of the Corps), a Platoon of Signaleers (responsible for military communications) and a Platoon trained in Trench Mortar and Bren Gun deployment (specialising in weaponry). The Cadet Band, now a mixed orchestral marching band, was a regularly anticipated feature of school pageants and until only recently did the College Band, ‘March On,’ leading participants to swimming galas and athletics meetings.

Such was the standing of the Marist Cadet Corps that it was regularly invited to perform in official state duties and 1931 General F. Theron came to inspect the Cadets at Observatory, a photo of which appeared in the Rand Daily Mail. In 1947 school cadet corps lined Louis Botha Avenue (then the main road in and out of Johannesburg) to stand to attention in honour of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (and the Princesses, one now Queen Elizabeth II) whose Rolls Royce drove past en route to Pretoria.
