When the Cadet Corps was reformed it was affiliated to the Transvaal Scottish Volunteers and guided by their Captain, George Herbert Roy, an alumnus of Koch Street. In 1906 Captain Roy oversaw the commissioning of several of the Marist Brothers, approved by the then Principal of Koch Street, Brother Callixte. At this time the Koch Street Annual Report to the parent body revealed some of the concerns of the parent body around the Cadet Corpsâ€™ existence. The document also relays some of the historical sentiment around the purpose of the Cadets.
