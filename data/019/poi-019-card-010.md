The College opened its first Computer Centre in 1984 with fifteen Ataris and four IBM PCs for use by its learners – initially for the Primary School but soon after extended to the High School learners as well. The collection of computers grew as fast as funding would allow; initially, to recoup some of the costs involved, a Computer Club was set up for staff and learners outside of classroom hours – at a joining fee of R10 per person. Today the Primary School Computer Centre has been updated with flat-screened desktops, and the school is equipped throughout with a wifi network and Apple products (Apple TV, desktops and iPads). All High School learners participate in the BYOD (bring your own device) programme, which grooms workforce-ready students who can collaborate in up-to-the-minute ways and seamlessly transfer their learning outside of the classroom. Learners are introduced to coding, app development and game design as well as the more traditional IT skills.
