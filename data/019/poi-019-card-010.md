The College opened its first Computer Centre in 1984 with fifteen Ataris and four IBM PCs for use by its learners – initially for the Primary School but soon after extended for the High School learners as well. The collection of computers grew as fast as funding would allow; initially, to recoup some of the costs involved a computer club was set up for staff and learners to join outside of classroom hours – at R10 per person. Today the Primary School computer centre has been updated with flat-screened desktops and the school is equipped throughout with a wifi network and Apple products (Apple TV, desktops and iPads) and all High School learners participate in the BYOD (bring your own device) program which enables workforce ready students who can collaborate in up to the minute ways and seamlessly transfer their learning outside of the classroom. Provision at the College introduces leaners to coding, app development and game design as well as the more traditional IT skills.
