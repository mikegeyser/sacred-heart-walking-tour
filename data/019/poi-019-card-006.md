In 1935 Captain Roy’s sword was presented to the College Cadet Corps by his sister Edith Pooley along with other Cadet memorabilia such as photo albums of cadet camps, badges and documents. The sword, embossed with an inscription that reads ‘Marist Bros Cadet Corps’, is still in the possession of the school. Made of solid silver, wood and leather the sword is about 105 cm in length and has an intricately carved handle depicting the monogram of King Edward VII (dating the sword to the early 1900s). Edward VII re-organised the British Forces after the Anglo-Boer War, including the company to which the Marist Cadet Corps was affiliated. The blade (81cm) is still protected by its original leather scabbard.
