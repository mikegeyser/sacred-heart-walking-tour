The Marist Brothers Cadet Corps was founded in 1895. The Cadet Corps had made their first official appearance at the Rand Agricultural Show of that same year and there attracted the attention of the President, Paul Kruger. The State decreed them a Naval Brigade and dressed the boys in sailor suits and provided Martini-Henry Carbines and Bayonets. The young ‘middies’, as they were known at that time (‘middies’ being an abbreviation of midshipman another name for a sailor) financed their own ammunition and military training. That they were a Naval Brigade was probably due to the hopes of the then Republican Government to annex Natal and extend the Republic to become a maritime colony. 

Later, the corps acted as a bodyguard to President Kruger when he addressed the people of Johannesburg at the Union Grounds (which was also used, along side the Old Wanderers grounds, as a sports field and for Cadet drills by the boys at Koch Street). Not long after, during the South African War, the corps was furnished with dummy rifles and then disbanded after an official mandate was sent from Pretoria by the Republican Government “incase they prove a menace to the state.”
