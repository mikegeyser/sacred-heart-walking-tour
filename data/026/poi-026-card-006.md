Both the primary and secondary schools were permitted to wear a mix of blazer badges until the mid 1980s in the years immediately after the amalgamation of schools. In this image you can make out at least three (the old and new badge at Sacred Heart, and the Ursuline badge). The dresses worn by the girls were also a mix of styles – today’s ‘banana dress’ is an adaptation of the dress that came from Holy Family, Yeoville (seen on the girl on far left). Another style of dress, a pinafore with collarless shirt underneath, from St Angela’s, was also worn (seen on the girl in far right of picture).
