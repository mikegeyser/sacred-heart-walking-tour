Both the primary and secondary schools were permitted to wear a mix of blazer badges until the mid 1980s in the years immediately after the amalgamation of schools. In this image you can make out at least three (the old and new badge at Sacred Heart, and the Ursuline badge). The dresses worn by the girls were also a mix of styles – today’s ‘banana dress’ is an adaptation of the dress that came from Holy Family, Yeoville (seen on the girl on far left). Another style of dress, a pinafore with collarless shirt underneath, from St Angela’s, was also worn (seen on the girl in far right of picture).

In 1986 the College proposed a two section High School with either Afrikaans or English offered as the medium of instruction (rather than only English). In addition, Sotho, French, Portuguese and Italian were offered as second languages. Though the whole school (Nursery, Primary and High School) was to retain the name Sacred Heart College, the High School was renamed Observatory College/Kollege. Both instruction medium groups were combined for sporting and cultural activities but split for Languages, Mathematics, Physical and Social Sciences. This dual first language programme lasted only a couple of years.
