This badge, created in 1985 by Kobus Esterhuizen, symbolised the Afrikaans/English initiative, but has lasted for at least thirty years longer than the initial reason for its design. The Cross with crook is set within a Huguenot Cross to signify the union of both the Catholic and Reformed theological traditions within the mediums of instruction to be offered. The Alpha and Omega, the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, used together signify wholeness, and were incorporated to symbolise the diverse (religious, racial and cultural) and co-educational nature of the school. The hearts in the centre are the three petals of the Holy Family shamrock and a fourth for the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The stars from the Ursuline badge (only five can be seen, the other two are artistically ‘hidden’ behind the logo) are those of the constellation Ursula Minor (or little bear), which points to the Pole star, traditionally the star towards which one looks to for direction. As such, the badge speaks to more than just the dual language programme that it was created around, but commemorates the union of three schools and celebrates the diverse and inclusive nature of the College community.
