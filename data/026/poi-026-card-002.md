In 1933, the striped blazer replaced a plain blue blazer with a blue and gold edging after the Provincial Council of South African Marists’ resolution:

> “The uniform of all Marist schools in the country must include a light navy-blue blazer of Venetian cloth with pairs of gold-yellow stripes an eighth inch wide and an eight inch apart, at a distance of 1 ½ inch between each pair.”

The Marist Centenary Digest (1967) explains the blue and gold combination:

> “Some claim that the colours were brought to South Africa from St Joseph’s College at Dumfries in Scotland. Others say that the blue was chosen for Marist (blue for Our Lady) and the gold from the white and gold of the Papal colours… that blue is the colour of the heavens which bids us cherish the highest ideals; and that gold represents the sterling qualities of character which the Brothers endeavour to instil in their pupils.”
