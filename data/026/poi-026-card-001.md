The Brothers however always wore ‘uniform’ when performing their duties at school. Their black soutanes (robes) with white starched split rectangular collars earnt them the nickname of “crows” amongst the boys both at Koch Street and in Observatory.

The first official and compulsory uniforms were introduced at the former Marist school in Pietermaritzburg (then Maritzburg) in 1927 by then Principal Br Paul-Camille. This consisted of a blue blazer of with a braid of alternate sections of blue and gold around the edges of the lapel, pockets and cuffs. Br Paul- Camille had been stationed in the early 1900s at the Cala Marist Brothers College in then Tembuland, possibly he took the idea from the blue and gold uniform worn by cadets there at the time. The earliest evidence of the Blue and Gold combination as “Marist” in South Africa is in the 1903 edition of the Marist College Uitenhage magazine called “Blue & Gold”. As the Uitenhage college was the fifth Marist school to open in South Africa, it is likely that these colours had already been adopted at the earlier schools in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth but no documentation exists to confirm this. Br Paul-Camille became Principal at Sacred Heart (Observatory) in 1935\.
