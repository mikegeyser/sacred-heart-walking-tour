This badge was designed by Sister Mara O.S.U. who was Deputy Principal of the Junior Primary school at the time. It combined symbols from the three schools that joined together in 1980. These three schools were Sacred Heart College Observatory, Holy Family Convent, Yeoville and St. Angela’s Convent, Bezuidenhout Valley. The AM monogram for Sacred Heart College (or Marist Obs) is preserved in the badge. The Holy Family Convent (which continued to house the Sacred Heart nursery school until the 1990s) shamrock, representing the Holy Family (Jesus, Mary and Joseph), is found at the bottom right. The seven stars in the Ursuline badge (for St Angela’s Convent was run by the Ursuline Order) are arranged in the constellation of Ursula Minor. In this badge the seven stars are rearranged and attached to the Cross, the symbol of Christianity, which bound all three schools together. The Cross was represented with a crook at the top. A crook is used by both Bishops and shepherds –  for both it is a tool that speaks to the care and management of a flock.
