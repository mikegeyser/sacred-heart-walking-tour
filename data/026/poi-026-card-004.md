This badge shown was used on Honours blazers only (with varying blues and widths of stripes used until the 1980s) and was used only until the 1960s. After that it was used as a blazer badge for ‘ordinary’ school blazers in the 1970s. Today plain blue blazers recognise outstanding academic, sports and cultural achievement as well as community service. In order to get a blue blazer, High School learners first have to be awarded a gold badge and then a scroll. LLC Presidents wear plain blue blazers with a gold piping (rather like the first school blazers).  The badge shown has three gold stampers in the top right segment, similar to the crest of the City of Johannesburg and an allusion to the location of the College being in the mining town. The left-hand symbol is the lamp of learning and below it is the AM monogram. The reason for the addition of the green and red was perhaps was a way to include the two other school house colours not represented by the blue and gold already in the crest. The school motto ‘In Meliora Contende’, meaning ‘strive for better things’, is embroidered at the bottom of the badge.
