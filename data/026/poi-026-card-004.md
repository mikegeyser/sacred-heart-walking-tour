The blazer badge shown in this image is that of the school badge that was created especially for the College. Blazer badges, in the past, were not necessarily the same as that of the school badges or crests. Though today this is not the case as the college crest is that which appears on the blazer badge.

The badge shown here was used on Honours blazers only (like the one shown here with varying blues and widths of stripes used until the 1980s) and was used only up until the 1960s and after that as a blazer badge for ‘ordinary’ school blazers in the 1970s and early 1980s. Honours blazers today are not striped but plain blue with gold edging – rather like the first school blazers.

The school badge has a panel showing three gold stampers in the top right segment, similar to what appears on the crest of the City of Johannesburg and an allusion to location of the college being in the mining town. The left hand symbol is that of the lamp of learning and below is the AM monogram. The reason for the addition of the green and red is not clear but demonstrate the two other colours of the school houses (not represented by the blue and gold already in the crest). The school motto ‘In Meliora Contende’ meaning ‘strive for better’ is embroidered at the bottom of the badge.
