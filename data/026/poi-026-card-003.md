M.B.C stood for Marist Brothers College and was emblazoned below the badge with the Marist monogram AM at Sacred Heart Colleges at Koch Street and at Observatory. The monogram consists of the letters A and M intertwined representing the Marist’s motto Ad Jesum per Mariam (To Jesus through the way of Mary). AM as a Catholic monogram (usually standing for Ave Maria – praise/hail Mary) is not unique to the Marist Brothers but AM in this distinctive yellow and blue script is internationally associated with the Marist Congregation. This blazer crest, with M.B.J, is still used on ‘ordinary’ blazers (as opposed to Honors blazers) at St David’s College, Inanda and at Marian College, Linmeyer.
