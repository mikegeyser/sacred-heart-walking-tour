Brother Vidal arrived in South Africa in 1902 suffering ‘galloping consumption’ (tuberculosis) and doctors in Cape Town gave him three months to live. He moved to Johannesburg where the altitude strengthened his lungs, and astounded the medical profession by not only living to the age of 95 but by becoming a PT teacher, gymnastics enthusiast and soccer coach.  Another article in The Star (undated) reported that he volunteered as a traffic cop ensuring that learners were able to safely cross the roads to and from school. The 1962 Maristonian remarked in his obituary that “perhaps he will be best remembered among the laity for his many remedies for almost all sorts of diseases. For some these proved beneficial, for others a trial that was not repeated.” Brother Martin, the late Marist Archivist, kept a list of his remedies and noted that it was the ‘Hail Marys’ offered at the end of each treatment that were the only potentially non-lethal part of the process!

Over the 150 years that the Marists have been in Johannesburg many hundreds of Brothers have served to educate the youth at the three Gauteng Marist schools. Their presence has impacted the wider community in numerous ways. Some of these Brothers are mentioned in this App; these are but a selection. In this group of slides, the main focus is on the Brothers who lived, or continue to live, at the Eckstein Street Brothers’ Residence.
