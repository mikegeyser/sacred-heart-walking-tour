Brother Jude, describes himself as ‘working with young people’ but this only tells one small portion (though with a huge impact) of his contributions to the progress made in South African society in the struggle against apartheid and the desegregation of its education system. Educated at St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch from Standard 4, he professed his first Marist vows in 1959. Brother Jude has taught in several Marist schools in South Africa and Australia, including Sacred Heart College, and served as Principal at the Marist College in Port Elizabeth. In 1974 Br Jude was appointed the first Marist Provincial of Southern Africa, created to administer for six countries on the continent rather than just South Africa (as the Province had been since 1908), and served another two terms in this role from 1995. In the late 1970s Brother Jude became part of the Chapter of Brothers in Rome and still fulfils this position as Councillor for the Southern African Province. 

Brother Jude founded the Catholic Institute of Education in 1985, an associated body of the  Southern African Catholic Bishops’ Conference, of which he was Secretary General at the time. Over the years he has served on a variety of committees, boards and trusts relating to the development of Catholic education and effected an inordinate amount of transformation through these roles. In recent years Brother Jude set up the Marist Schools Council and much of his time is devoted to effecting change through this body.
