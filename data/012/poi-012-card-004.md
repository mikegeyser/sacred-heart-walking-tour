Brother Jude describes himself as ‘working with young people’ but this is only one small part (though with huge impact) of his contributions to transformative processes in South African society. Educated at St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch from Standard 2 (now Grade 4), he professed his first Marist vows in 1959. Br Jude has taught in several Marist schools in South Africa and Australia, including Sacred Heart College, and was Principal at the Marist College in Port Elizabeth. Br Jude served as Provincial Superior of the former Province of South Africa, firstly for three terms beginning in 1974, and then for another term in the late 90’s. When, in 1999, the Marist Province of Southern Africa was formed, he served another two terms as Provincial Superior. He is currently one of the six Provincial Councillors; one for each of Angola, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa.

Br Jude became Secretary General of the South African Catholic Bishops’ Conference in the late 1980s and Director of the Catholic Institute of Education, which he founded in 1985. In this latter role he was a driving force in talks with the apartheid government around the desegregation of schools. Over the years he has contributed to positive change in the country, not least during the ‘80s and ‘90s in missions relating to social justice, and in terms of the development of national and Catholic education policies. Recently Br Jude set up the Marist Schools Council, which focuses on the development of Marist education in South Africa, and continues to center his spiritual calling at a grass roots level in this way.
