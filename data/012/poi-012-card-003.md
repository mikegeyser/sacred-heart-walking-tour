Brother Paul became a Marist Brother just a few years after finishing school (Athlone Boys’ High School) in Johannesburg in 1924. Br Paul trained in Italy, and on returning to South Africa in 1926 taught at many of the Marist Schools, including Koch Street and Observatory. He was elected to represent the South African Brothers at the General Chapter in Italy in 1946. He then spent some years recruiting for the Province of South Africa in northern Europe. In 1957, having suffered degenerative eyesight by this time, he had an operation in London. The operation was not successful and Br Paul was thereafter totally blind. 

Br Paul returned to South Africa to live with the Brothers at Observatory, where he remained until 1998 when he moved to a Catholic care facility, Nazareth House in Yeoville. The boys at the school organised a collection for Br Paul to buy his guide dog. He learnt braille and immersed himself in charitable work to assist the blind, particularly in social welfare. In 1967, Br Paul founded “The Guild of St. Theresa for the Blind”, a charitable institution, assisted by the Sisters of Charity to practically assist and financially support the blind in disadvantaged communities. The Siloe School for the Blind, near Pietermaritzburg, is one of the foundations supported by St. Theresa’s Guild. Br Paul’s obituary, published in 2000 in the College Yearbook, commented that the children at the Siloe School 'know more about Br Paul than they do about the Pope!'
