Brother Paul became a Marist Brother just a few years after finishing school in Johannesburg in 1924 (at Athlone Boys’ High School). Brother Paul trained in Italy and on returning to South Africa in 1926 and taught at many of the Marist Schools, including Koch Street and Observatory. He was elected to represent the South African Brothers at the General House in Italy in 1946 where he spent the next ten years. In 1957, having suffered degenerative eyesight during his time in Italy, he had an operation in London. The operation was not successful and Brother Paul was thereafter totally blind. 

Brother Paul returned to South Africa to live with the Brothers at Observatory (where he remained until 1998 when he moved to Nazareth House when he needed the support of a Nursing Home). The boys at the school organised a collection for Brother Paul to buy his guide dog. He learnt braille and immersed himself in charitable work to assist the blind, particularly in social welfare. In 1967, Brother Paul founded “The Guild of St. Theresa’s for the Blind”, a charitable institution, assisted by the Sisters of Charity to practically assist and financially support the blind in disadvantaged communities. The Siloe School for the Blind, near Pietermaritzburg, is one of the foundations supported by St. Theresa’s Guild. Brother Paul’s Obituary, published in 2000 in the College yearbook, commented that the children at the Siloe School (a Catholic foundation) know more about Brother Paul than the Pope!
