Born in Port Elizabeth, Br Joseph was educated at Marist College in Uitenhage (as was his father) and after the Marist Juniorate in Hibberdene, KZN. Like all Marist Brothers of his generation he spent several years at a Juniorate (where they completed Matric with focus on their vocational choice), another year in a Postulancy (preparation to enter the next stage of Marist formation) and a further year at a Novitiate (during which ones’ first vows are made). Brother Joseph’s Novitiate year included teaching practice at St. David’s College, Inanda and thereafter he taught at Marian College, Linmeyer and St. Charles’ College, Pietermaritzburg and St. Joseph’s, Rondebosch (where he was Primary School Principal). In the 1980s Brother Joseph was the founder Principal of Trinity House school in Port Elizabeth (a joint venture between the Marists and the Dominican Sisters) and during this time was also Superintendent for the Diocesan Mission Schools. 

From 1991-2000 Brother Joseph was Principal of the Primary School at Sacred Heart College which he fondly recalls as ‘a great ten years of my apostolic life’. Brother Joseph oversaw the move of the Primary School back to the Eckstein Street premises from its temporary home in Yeoville.  Brother Joseph, a gentle but firm, much loved Principal was appointed by Rome to oversee new Brothers’ formation in Kenya in 2000. In 2005 he returned to live at the Brothers’ Residence at Sacred Heart on his election as Deputy Marist Provincial and from 2010-2016 served two terms as Marist Provincial for Southern Africa. Brother Joseph has recently moved from Observatory to continue Marist mission work in the Western Cape.
