Born in Port Elizabeth, Brother Joseph was educated at Marist College in Uitenhage (as was his father) and the Marist Juniorate in Hibberdene, KZN. Like all Marist Brothers of his generation he spent a year in a Postulancy (preparation to enter the next stage of Marist formation) and a further year at a Novitiate (during which ones’ first vows are made). Br Joseph’s Novitiate year included teaching practice at St. David’s, Inanda, after which he taught at Marian College, Linmeyer, St. Charles’ College, Pietermaritzburg, and St. Joseph’s, Rondebosch, where he was Primary School Principal. In the 1980s Br Joseph was the founder Principal of Trinity High School in Port Elizabeth (a joint venture between the Marists and the Dominican Sisters) and spent a year as Superintendent for the Diocesan Mission Schools. 

From 1991-2000 Br Joseph was Principal of the Primary School at Sacred Heart College which he fondly recalls as ‘a great ten years of my apostolic life’. Br Joseph oversaw the move of the Foundation Phase back to the Eckstein Street premises from its temporary home in Yeoville. Br Joseph, a gentle but firm, much loved Principal, was appointed to join the staff of the Brothers’ tertiary formation house in Nairobi in 2000. In 2005 he returned to live at the Brothers’ Residence at Sacred Heart on his election as Deputy Marist Provincial and from 2010-2016 served two terms as Marist Provincial for Southern Africa. Brother Joseph recently moved from Observatory to continue Marist mission work in the Western Cape.
