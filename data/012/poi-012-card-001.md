The Brothers lived, as they do today, in community residence at Marist institutions that they served. Prior to 1985, the Brothers based at Sacred Heart College lived in rooms on the upper floor of the main building which today have been converted into the staff room and several offices (including those of the school counsellor and the chaplain). In 1985 a new residence was completed for the Brothers which provided rooms for 11 Brothers, a mall Chapel space, a dining room and a communal lounge. The single storey building, partly incorporating the Manual Training Hall, was practically designed to comfortably accommodate more elderly Brothers.
