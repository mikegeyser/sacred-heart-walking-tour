Brother Mario learnt the war cry for St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch well before he became there a pupil in the early 1940s, from his elder brother. Aged 15 he decided to become a Marist and moved to the Hibberdene Juniorate to complete his schooling. After his Postulancy and Novitiate in Australia, completed contemporaneously with Brother Jude, he returned to South Africa. Studying through UNISA he completed his teaching practice at Sacred Heart College, then Marist ‘Obs’, teaching amongst other subjects, Afrikaans. Brother Mario taught at a number of Marist schools including fourteen years at St. David’s College, Inanda. Brother Mario continues to help with formation of the spiritual life of St. David’s today. After studying on a bursary at Berkeley, California in the late 1970s, Brother Mario set to training young Marists, first at Seminaries in former homelands of Transkei and Bophuthatswana, later in Kenya running the teaching practice department at the Marist International University College for eight years. He also undertook further studies, in the sciences, at the University of Louvain in Belgium and in Rome. 

Brother Mario returned to Johannesburg, living in the Brother’s Residence from 1999-2005, and continued to focus on teacher training, though this time of lay Marists involved in all five South African Marist schools. From 2005-2010, based in Cape Town and Uitenhage he continued to run workshops for lay Marists until being appointed Secretary to Brother Joseph, then Marist Provincial, and he returned to live in Observatory. Brother Mario continues to write educational support materials for the Institute of Marist Brothers.
