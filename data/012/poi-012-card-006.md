Brother Mario’s elder brother taught him the war cry for St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch well before he became there a pupil in the early 1950s. Aged 15 he decided to become a Marist and moved to the Hibberdene Juniorate to complete his secondary schooling. After his postulancy and novitiate in Australia (completed contemporaneously with Brother Jude), he returned to South Africa. After obtaining a B.Sc. degree at the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg, he taught at St David’s College, Inanda for 14 years. During this period he studied part-time through UNISA ending with a Masters in Education. He is grateful to the Superiors for allowing him to take advantage of a bursary to follow a summer programme at the University of California (science teaching), and another one at the University of Louvain (theology) many years later. He has also benefitted from a renewal programme in Rome and a year of study at the Gregorian University in the same city. He has served as a teacher in two former South African homelands and spent eight years as a formator at the Marist International College in Nairobi. 

On returning to South Africa, Br Mario devoted a number of years to formation of Marist educators in the spirit of St Marcellin. In 2010, he was appointed as Secretary to the Province of Southern Africa and personal secretary to Brother Joseph, the Provincial Superior. He currently continues that service under Brother Norbert who replaced Br Joseph in 2016.
