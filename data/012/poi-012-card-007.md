Brother Vincent’s connection with the Marist Brothers began as an 11-year-old boarder at St. Charles’ College, Pietermaritzburg in 1956. He took his first vows in 1968 at the Stellenbosch Novitiate (together with Brother Joseph). In 1972 Brother Vincent came to Marist ‘Obs’ to teach Standard 5, sports and the Cadet band. Brother Vincent recalls he and Brother Neil (part of the staff by then) walking to Ellis Park Stadium and the Yeoville Bioscope at the weekends. They threw gravel up to the windows of the Brother’s corridor to awaken someone to open up if they arrived back after the internal gates were locked (his room is now occupied by the College Counsellor). 

After fifteen years teaching PE between Marist schools in Port Elizabeth and Durban, he was posted to the Slough Marist mission in the Kalahari in 1986. There, Brother Vincent cultivated his interest in practical work, qualifying for a diploma in Technical Studies at Wits’ Technikon in the late 1980s. He taught Technical Studies at Slough, Uitenhage and in Port Elizabeth until 2007 when he transferred back to Sacred Heart taking over as Maintenance Manager, a role which he continues today.
