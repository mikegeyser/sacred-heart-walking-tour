In 1957, aged 8, Brother Vincent began boarding with the Marists at St. Charles’ College, Pietermaritzburg. From there he went to the Marist Juniorate in Hibberdene, Natal. In 1968 he took his first vows at the Marist Novitiate (together with Brother Joseph) in Stellenbosch. In 1971, after a year at the Marist Scholasticate in Pietermaritzburg, Br Vincent came to Marist ‘Obs’ to teach Standard 5 and coach sports and the Cadet band. Br Vincent recalls walking to Ellis Park Stadium and the Yeoville Bioscope with Brother Neil on occasional weekends. His bedroom is now the College Counsellor’s office. 

In 1973 Br Vincent continued his Marist formation in Australia, thereafter spending fifteen years between Marist schools in Port Elizabeth and Durban. Posted to the Slough Marist mission in the Kalahari Desert in 1986, he taught in the local school and cultivated his interest in practical work. In 1990 he received an H.D.Ed in Technical Studies at the Johannesburg College of Education. He taught Technical Studies at Slough and at the Xhosa-speaking Dominican Convent High School in Uitenhage until 2007, when he transferred back to Sacred Heart as Maintenance Manager, a role he continues today.
