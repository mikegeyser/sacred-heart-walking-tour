Brother Vincent’s connection with the Marist Brothers began as an 11-year-old boarder at St. Charles’ College, Pietermaritzburg in 1956. He took his first vows in 1968 at the Stellenbosch Novitiate (together with Br Joseph). In 1972 Br Vincent came to Marist ‘Obs’ to teach Standard 5, sports and the Cadet Band. Br Vincent recalls how he and Br Neil (part of the staff by then) would walk to Ellis Park Stadium and the Yeoville Bioscope on weekends. They would throw gravel up at the windows of the Brothers’ corridor to awaken someone to open up if they arrived back after the internal gates were locked. Br Vincent’s room is now occupied by the College Counsellor. 

After fifteen years between Marist schools in Port Elizabeth and Durban, Br Vincent was posted to the Slough Marist mission in the Kalahari in 1986. There he cultivated his interest in practical work, qualifying for a diploma in Technical Studies at Wits Technikon in the late 1980s. He taught Technical Studies at Slough, Uitenhage and in Port Elizabeth until 2007 when he transferred back to Sacred Heart, taking over as Maintenance Manager, a role he still plays today.
