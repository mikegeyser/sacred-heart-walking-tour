This statue of Our Lady of Good Hope was made in Europe and sent by Br Procope, Marist Superior in the 1880s, to the Marist College at Uitenhage, Our Lady of Good Hope College at a cost of £7 and 15 shillings, according to the Uitenhage annals of 1890, recorded by Br Nectaire. When that College closed in the 1950s, the statue was moved to Port Elizabeth, where the Brothers in that area continued to live. When Br Joseph became Principal of the Primary School at Sacred Heart College he arranged for the statue to be moved to Johannesburg, for he had developed a fondness for it during his days as a learner at the Marist College in Walmer. When Br Joseph was made Provincial in 2010 he arranged for a copy of the statue to be made, and it is this copy that sits in the niche in the College façade today. The niche had been empty for nearly thirty years after the statue of Jesus with the Sacred Heart was moved from that spot in 1979 when the school reverted to the use of its religious name upon becoming co-educational in 1980.
