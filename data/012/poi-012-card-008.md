Brother Neil, whose uncle Gerald McGurk taught at Sacred Heart College for 43 years, and whose uncle Edwin McGurk was Provincial in the 1950s and 60s, began his own journey with Marist ‘Obs’ aged 14. Br Neil began teaching science at Marist ‘Obs’ in 1965. A veritable academic, with reams of published research in topics as diverse as education and race, cosmology and nucleic forces, he has inspired generations of learners. From 1975 to 1999 he was Director of the College. Sim Tshabalala, now joint CEO of Standard Bank, and one of the first black students admitted to the College, said of his former Headmaster:
>“I learned a lot from him and in particular, I gained a love of philosophy and deep desire to help out – at least a little – to make South Africa a better place.”      (Tshabalala, 2011)

Under Br Neil’s leadership, the College defied government decree and opened the school to boys of all races in 1976. In 1980, he was responsible for the change to co-education and the integrated studies curriculum. Br Neil has made invaluable contributions to South African society, including negotiating educational reform with the pre-1994 government, leading to the remodelling and desegregation of schools, assisting the ANC before and after its unbanning with socio-cultural missions, and the integration of returning exiles in conjunction with the Batlagae Trust. Br Neil continues to work tirelessly for social development with Catholic NGOs in the country; one current project, ‘The Culture of Learning’ in KZN, provides skill training in education and community development.
