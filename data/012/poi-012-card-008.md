Brother Neil’s uncle Gerald McGurk taught at Sacred Heart College for 43 years and another uncle, Edwin McGurk, was Marist Provincial in the 1950s and 1960s. He began his own journey with Marist ‘Obs’ aged 14 in Standard 9. A veritable academic, with reams of published research in topics as diverse education and race, cosmology and nucleic forces, Brother Neil has inspired generations of learners. Brother Neil began teaching science at Marist ‘Obs’ in 1965 and from 1975 to 1999 was Director of College. Sim Tshabalala, alumnus and joint CEO of Standard Bank, said of his former Headmaster:
>“I learned a lot from him and in particular, I gained a love of philosophy and deep desire to help out – at least a little – to make South Africa a better place.”      (Tshabalala, 2011)

Under Br Neil’s leadership, the College defied government decree and opened the school to boys of all races in 1976. In the 1980s, he was responsible for the move to co-education and the integrated studies curriculum. Outside of the College’s community, Br Neil has made invaluable contributions to society including negotiating educational reform with the pre-1994 Government leading to the remodelling and desegregation of schools, assisting the ANC before and after its unbanning with socio-cultural missions and the integration of the returning exiles in conjunction with the Batlagae trust. Br Neil continues to work tirelessly for social development with Catholic NGOs in the country; one current project ‘The Culture of Learning’ in KZN provides skill training in education and community development.
