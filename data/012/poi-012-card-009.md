Marist Brothers are not priests, but have nonetheless made vows to live a spiritual life in community with other Brothers, focused on education as their founder, Marcellin Champagnat (who was a priest), established in 1817. Father David Dryden, not a Marist Brother but a Jesuit Priest, has been the Sacred Heart College Chaplain since 1983, after serving at St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch, for the previous decade. Father Dryden is concurrently the Chaplain at Marian College, Linmeyer and he devotes one day each week to each school. 

Father Dryden’s duties as Chaplain include pastoral care, religious instruction for Catholic children and religious education in a general sense, as well as conducting Masses and other special ceremonies (such as First Holy Communion and Confirmation). He has contact in these capacities with all ages at the school, from Pre-Primary to Matric, and also with staff members.
