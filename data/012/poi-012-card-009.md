Father Dryden, not a Marist Brother but a Jesuit priest, has been the Sacred Heart College Chaplain since 1983 after serving at St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch for the previous decade. Father Dryden is concurrently the Chaplain at Marian College, Linmeyer and spends half of the week at each school. Marist Brothers are not priests, but have nonetheless made vows to live a spiritual life in community with other Brothers, focused on education as their founder, Marcellin Champagnat (who was a priest), established in 1817. 

Father Dryden’s duties as Chaplain include pastoral care, religious instruction for Catholic children and religious education in a general sense as well as the conduction of Masses and other special ceremonies (such as First Holy Communion and Confirmation). He has contact in these capacities with all ages at the school, from Pre-Primary to Matric and with staff members.
