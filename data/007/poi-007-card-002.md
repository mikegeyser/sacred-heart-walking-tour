The Pre-Primary building was designed in the 1990s to resemble 1920s main buildings of the College and at the same time reflect and incorporate features (such as the indigenous trees) of the triangular shaped part of the Orchard that it was to be built in. The Pre-Primary was built to accommodate 250 children in 9 classrooms, with extra spaces such as a library, staff offices, a large multi-functional foyer and an aftercare facility. The buildings and landscaped play areas were designed to connect the pre-schoolers with their Orchard setting; pens for farmyard animals were also included in the colonnaded verandahs along with aviaries and a vegetable patch were also provided.

Some of the first Pre-Primary residents included sheep, pigs and ducks that mingled with the children in the specially enclosed play area.
