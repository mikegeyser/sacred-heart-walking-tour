Colin Northmore, Head of College, recounts an anecdote about the two pillars which could be said to represent the opposing views of The Surveyor and The Architect for the Pre-Primary building project. There was a disagreement over whether The Orchard land that was set aside for the new buildings was over landfill or a ridge of quartz. Of course this would have made a difference to the depth of the foundations that were to be laid and to the final design and structure of the building. They threw their hats on the ground during ‘discussions’ and, it turned out, this was the ideal place at which to test their theories by digging exploratory holes. The two pillars not only conveniently hold the plaques that mark the beginnings of the Pre-Primary but the middle ground that was found between their two plans and the start of the two men working together with a shared vision. Of course the pillars also mark the physical entry point into the Pre-Primary Foyer.
