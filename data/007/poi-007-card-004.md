The Holy Family Convent school was built in Yeoville in 1914\. The colonnaded verandahs and balconies shown in this picture are still a feature of the school today however the grounds and buildings themselves are no longer in good repair. The allocated government subsidy doesn’t stretch to covering the buildings’ maintenance (purchased by the Department of Education in 2003) as well as providing for some of the other needs of the staff and pupils at Yeoville Community School, such as learning equipment and salaries.

In the first few years after Nelson Mandela’s release from prison and during his Presidency he was a regular visitor to the Sacred Heart community and until 1995, this was at both campuses. In the early 1990s Mandela attended one of the Junior Primary concerts at the Yeoville campus and was so impressed by the diversity and cohesion of the students and staff that he advised Oliver Tambo to attend to see for himself how the new South Africa could and should be. Oliver Tambo indeed joined the audience of the concert the next evening.
