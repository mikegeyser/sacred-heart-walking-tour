After the consolidation of three schools into Sacred Heart College in 1980, the increased pupil roll (from 500 to over 800) all learners could not be accommodated at the Observatory campus. The Holy Family Convent was used for the Sacred Heart College Junior Primary and Nursery schools. In 1993, after the completion of the new buildings (which now form the Intermediate Quad) the Junior Primary was moved back to Observatory. The classrooms vacated by the Junior Primary of Sacred Heart College at Yeoville were given over to the foundation of a new school, Yeoville Community School. 

The Holy Family Convent school was built in Yeoville in 1914. The colonnaded verandahs and balconies shown in this picture are still a feature of the school today however the grounds and buildings themselves are no longer in good repair. The allocated government subsidy doesn’t stretch to covering the buildings’ maintenance (purchased by the Department of Education in 2003) as well as providing for some of the other needs of the staff and pupils at Yeoville Community School, such as learning equipment and salaries.
