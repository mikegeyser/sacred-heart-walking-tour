Though the physical buildings of the Sacred Heart Pre-Primary School were built in 1995-1996, the story of the Pre-Primary section of the school is intertwined with that of the local community in Yeoville from 1914, and with the changing dynamic of inner city Johannesburg from the late 1980s. The existing Pre-Primary School’s foundation stone was laid by Bishop of Johannesburg, The Right Revd. Orsmond in 1995, and the facility was opened in 1996 by Prof. Bengu, Minister of Education.

Funding for the buildings was contributed by Anglo American and the De Beers Chairman’s Funds (in 1998 this became one fund), Sacred Heart’s Development Fund and the Genesis Foundation, amongst other donors. The two conical stone pillars outside the entrance contain plaques which remind passers-by of these facts. 

The Pre-Primary building was designed in the 1990s to resemble 1920s main buildings of the College and at the same time reflect and incorporate features (such as the indigenous trees) of the triangular shaped part of the Orchard that it was to be built in.
