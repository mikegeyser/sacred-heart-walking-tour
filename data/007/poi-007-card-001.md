Though the physical buildings of the Sacred Heart Pre-Primary School were built in 1995-1996 the story of the Pre-Primary section of the school is intertwined with that of the local community in Yeoville from 1914 and with the changing dynamic of inner city Johannesburg from the late 1980s. The existing Pre-Primary school’s foundation stone was laid by Bishop of Johannesburg, The Right Revd. Orsmond in 1995 and the facility was opened in 1996 by Prof. Bengu, Minister of Education.

Funding for the buildings was contributed by Anglo American and De Beers Chairman’s Funds (in 1998 this became one fund), Sacred Heart’s Development Fund and the Genesis Foundation amongst other donors. The two conical stone pillars outside the entrance contain plaques which remind passers by of these facts. However, these two stone towers are testament to a much richer communal narrative and this is outlined over the next few slides.

Colin Northmore recounts an anecdote about the two pillars which could be said to represent the opposing views of The Surveyor and The Architect for the Pre-Primary building project. There was a disagreement over whether The Orchard land that was set aside for the new buildings was over landfill or a ridge of quartz. Of course this would have made a difference to the depth of the foundations that were to be laid and to the final design and structure of the building. They threw their hats on the ground during ‘discussions’ and, it turned out, this was the ideal place at which to test their theories by digging exploratory holes. The two pillars not only conveniently hold the plaques that mark the beginnings of the Pre-Primary but the middle ground that was found between their two plans and the start of the two men working together with a shared vision. Of course the pillars also mark the physical entry point into the Pre-Primary Foyer.
