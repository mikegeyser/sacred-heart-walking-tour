Teacher Boitomelo Letho, who has taught at the Pre-Primary since the Yeoville days, recalls Mandela’s visits telling of how Mandela sang ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star’ with the youngest Sacred Heart learners.

One of her favourite moments as a teacher of the grade 00s came when whilst leading them her class through the school grounds passing the statue of Jesus with Sacred Heart she overheard a discussion between a few of the 4 and 5 year olds. Was this perhaps the resting place of Jesus or Nelson Mandela they debated, for such a spot with this prominent statue as marker could only be, in their minds, a signifier for one of these two momentous figures that they hear in connection with their schools’ narrative in stories around social justice. Indeed, at a recent whole school Mass one of her students lent over and whispered “Look, Teacher Buti, Jesus has come to our school!”. The youngster had not, until that point, seen one of the Brothers dressed in a Soutane and didn’t recognise that it was the same man who had welcomed his class to the Brothers’ gardens to meet their resident tortoise only a few weeks before.
