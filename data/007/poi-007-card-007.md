Ms. Boitomelo Letho, who has taught at the Pre-Primary since the Yeoville days, tells of how Mandela loved to sing ‘Twinkle Twinkle Little Star’ with the youngest Sacred Heart learners. One of her favourite moments as a teacher of Grade 00 came whilst leading her class through the school grounds. Passing the statue of Jesus with Sacred Heart she overheard a discussion between a few of the 4 and 5 year olds. Was this perhaps the resting place of Jesus or Nelson Mandela they debated? Such a spot with this prominent statue as marker could only be, in their minds, a signifier for one of these two momentous figures that they hear in connection with their schools’ narrative in stories around social justice. 

“Wow, look it’s Jesus!” … “No, it’s not real” … “But it is actually where Jesus is buried” … “yes, it is like a signpost” … “well I think Nelson Mandela is buried here” … “at night maybe they talk to each other” ... 

Indeed, at a recent school Mass one of her students lent over and whispered, “Look, Teacher Buti, Jesus has come to our school!”. The youngster had not, before then, seen the Brothers dressed in their soutanes and didn’t recognise that it was the same man who’d welcomed his class to the Brothers’ gardens to meet their resident tortoise only a few weeks prior.
