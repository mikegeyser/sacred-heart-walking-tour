Grandparent’s (or special carers) Day remains a highlight of the Pre-Primary Calendar today. The Pre-Primary uses a Reggio approach curriculum which cultivates resilience, independent thinking and curiosity in the young learners. "

According to Brother Neil McGurk and Brother Joseph Walton, Principals of the College and Primary School respectively, when Nelson Mandela visited Sacred Heart College he liked to visit the Pre-Primary school in particular. During his time in prison he was starved of contact with children, not least of his own children and grandchildren. 

In the first few years after Nelson Mandela’s release from prison and during his Presidency he was a regular visitor to the Sacred Heart community and until 1995, this was at both campuses. In the early 1990s Mandela attended one of the Junior Primary concerts at the Yeoville campus and was so impressed by the diversity and cohesion of the students and staff that he advised Oliver Tambo to attend to see for himself how the new South Africa could and should be. Oliver Tambo indeed joined the audience of the concert the next evening.
