This statuette of Marcellin Champagnat kneeling in-front of the Virgin Mary and Child was made by celebrated Canadaian figurine maker E.Dini who was particularly renowned during the 1940s and 1950s for his painted plaster molded religious icons that have been collected all over the world. It is one of a few artefacts found around the Pre-Primary that speak to the Marist ethos and founders of the school. Another example is the statue of Jesus that is mounted in the foyer above the entry point to the reception office; this statue of Jesus was once installed above the altar in the Old Chapel and moved to its current position in the late 1990s.
