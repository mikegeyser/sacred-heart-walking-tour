The Pre-Primary was built to accommodate 250 children in 9 classrooms, with extra spaces such as a library, staff offices, a large multi-functional foyer and an aftercare facility. The buildings and landscaped play areas were designed to connect the pre-schoolers with their Orchard setting; aviaries and pens for farmyard animals were included in the colonnaded verandas. Sheep, pigs and ducks mingled with the children in the specially enclosed play area and there was also a vegetable patch for the learners to tend and watch grow. Though the animals are no longer part of the Pre-Primary community the vegetable garden remains, the mini-robots still function and the children enjoy following the life cycles of the guinea fowl that have made the Orchard their home. The play area used by the Pre-Primary today extends behind the initial landscaped play area to incorporate the a specially set aside part of the Orchard complete with a bug hotel, marble run and jungle gyms made of wood.
