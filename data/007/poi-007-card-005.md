Yeoville Community School, first headed by Jackie Stevenson (who came from the staff at Sacred Heart College) began as a school of less than 200 children, doubled again in size once the Sacred Heart Nursery/Pre-Primary relocated to Observatory after 1995, and now has a roll of over 1000 learners.

Children of the returning political exiles who began to come back to South Africa in the early 1990s formed a large section of the student body of the new Model C school. They were aided through the Batlagae Trust along with children from the existing inner-city area, who until this point were unable to access their local school. Many of the pupils had been denied access to other city schools, often on the grounds of language and educational inadequacies, and the new school saw to it that the bridging of these gaps was achieved, with pupils then able to access other mainstream schools in due course. 

Sacred Heart College and the Marist Brothers, who dealt with the Department of Education, were key to the establishment of quality education in that area. Many College staff moved to work at the new schools in order to provide experienced teachers to this community initiative. Barnato Park High School and Orange Grove Primary were amongst the first Model D schools opened in the early 1990s, established through efforts of the Marist Brothers and their supporters, many of whom were staff and parents of Sacred Heart College.
