According to Brother Neil McGurk and Brother Joseph Walton, Principals of the College and Primary School respectively, Nelson Mandela often liked to visit the Pre-Primary school in particular for of course during his time in prison he was starved of contact with children, not least his own children and grandchildren who in the 1990s were enrolled at Sacred Heart College.

Brother Joseph recollecting in 2016 about some of Mandela’s visits to the school:

> “I remember him coming here and it’s a silly little story but it shows the man himself, his humour … He was coming to visit the nursery school and I took him across and of course the children didn’t know who he was, just another person coming through and the children kept on saying “good morning Brother Joseph, good morning Brother Joseph, good morning Brother Joseph” and then he [Mandela] said to me “looks like you are more popular... you are more famous than I am!” and he laughed out loud.”

This is in contrast today’s learners at the Pre-Primary for, according to teacher Boitomelo Letho who has taught at the Pre-Primary since the Yeoville days, they are well informed about politics and world affairs, debating amongst themselves around topics as varied as Donald Trump and the Olympics and of course, the legacy of Nelson Mandela. One of her favourite moments as a teacher of the grade 00s came when. whilst leading them her class through the school grounds passing the statue of Jesus with Sacred Heart she overheard a discussion between a few of the 5 year olds. Was this perhaps the resting place of Jesus or Nelson Mandela they debated – for such a spot with this prominent statue as marker could only be, in their minds, a signifier for one of these two equally momentous figures in their schools’ narrative.
