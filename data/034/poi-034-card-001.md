The logo was designed by Kgomotso Mautloa, Matric 2003, Creative Director at design agency Green Robot. The representation of the College gates indicates how these are always open to the College’s alumni (hence the use of both the old and new school names above the gate). The alumni association began in 1902 at Koch Street, continued at ‘Obs’, and has been the community networking hub ever since. Alumni are encouraged to keep in touch with their Alma Mater and with each other, attend reunions or contribute in a variety of ways (e.g. careers talks or mentoring of current learners). The ‘M’ in the centre of the gates links to the words Marist and Meliores (a Latin noun meaning ‘strive for better’ or ‘always better’ and to which Meliora, an adjective and part of the school motto meaning ‘better’ or ‘best’, is related). 

Approximately 70,000 alumni have walked through the gates at Observatory. In the following slides and elsewhere in the app a number of alumni are featured, but they are a mere fraction of the tens of thousands of other alumni, all with their own stories, contributions and memories.
