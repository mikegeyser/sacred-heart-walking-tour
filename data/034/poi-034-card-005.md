In South Africa Joel Joffe is perhaps best known for having been attorney for Nelson Mandela and the other Rivonia Trialists (apart from James Kantor) in the mid 1960s. Joffe’s role on the Defense Team angered the Apartheid government who then restricted his movement, confiscating his passport. Joffe emigrated to England aided through immigration by Dick Taverne, Chairman of the World Campaign Committee of South African Political Prisoners (WCCSAPP) and British politician. Harold Wolpe, a Rivonia Trialist represented by Joffe, exiled in the UK since escaping from prison in 1963 was a member of WCCSAPP. The above picture, taken in January 2016, shows Joffe (2nd from right) with Ahmed Kathrada and Denis Goldberg (first and second left), both imprisoned after the Rivonia Trial, along with co attorney George Bizos (far right), receiving the Freedom of the City of London received in recognition of their fight for freedom and racial equality.
