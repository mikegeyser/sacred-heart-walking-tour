In South Africa, Joel Joffe is perhaps best known for having been the Defence Attorney for the Rivonia Trialists, including Mandela, in the mid 1960s. In so doing, Joffe angered the apartheid government, who confiscated his passport to restrict his movement. Joffe emigrated to England aided by British politician, Dick Taverne, Chairman of the World Campaign Committee of South African Political Prisoners (WCCSAPP). There, Joffe joined Harold Wolpe, whom he represented at the Rivonia Trial, exiled in the UK since his escape from prison in 1963. In January 2016, Joffe (2nd from right) along with Ahmed Kathrada and Denis Goldberg (1st and 2nd left, both imprisoned after the Rivonia Trial), and co-attorney George Bizos (far right), received the Freedom of the City of London in recognition of their fight for freedom and racial equality.
