In the November 2013 issue of Meliores, Brian Leong reflected on his families’ association with Sacred Heart College. He recalled watching the long jumpers, with his youngest daughter, at a recent inter-house athletics event and observed Mr Hollingworth taking measurements. It sparked a vivid memory of the same Mr Hollingworth demonstrating discus throwing thirty years before. 

Having started at the College in 1974, Brian recalled that ‘whilst many white government schools were going through emergency evacuation drills… Sacred Heart College began admitting pupils of all races…Sacred Heart College provided a haven which allowed me to experience a normal way of growing up in an abnormal society.’ Brian continues to appreciate the diversity of the student (and staff) body that allows his children to learn in an environment that reflects the hope that exists, but isn’t always apparent, in South African society. Brian’s wife, Penny, volunteers her time to facilitate reading and holiday programmes for Three2Six learners, assists with bi-annual retreats for grades 4-6 and chairs the Mindworks Committee, planning the biennial parent-led Primary School learning programme.
