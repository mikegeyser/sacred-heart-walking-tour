An excerpt from Isie Maisels QC’s obituary in The Sunday Times:
> Pre-eminent amongst his generation of advocates, he was one of the country’s most formidable legal minds, as well as a man whose life and interests reflected a deep concern for human rights and civil liberty. He was involved in some of the great court cases of the times, leading the defence of Nelson Mandela and others in the notorious treason trial of 1956								(Sunday Times 11.12.1994)

Unsurprisingly the National Party didn’t raise Maisels to Chief Justice, though he was considered the most deserving candidate by his peers, so after the Treason Trial, Maisels moved to serve in Southern Rhodesia’s High Court, later becoming Chief Justice in Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana. He returned to Johannesburg to practice law, retiring only a few years before his death.
