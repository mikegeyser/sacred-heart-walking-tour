In his semi-autobiography ‘A Life at Law’, Isie Maisels reflects on his time at Sacred Heart College where he started, age 7, in Standard 1. Maisels recalled being awarded the Valerian Prize (for the top academic achiever) in his Junior Matric year and how, some twenty-five years later, he met Brother Vital at Yeoville tram station, who remembered Maisels saying that he still recalled misspelling his name, before correcting it, in the awarded prize book. Masiels was a member of the 1st X1 cricket and 2nd XI soccer teams whilst at Koch Street.
