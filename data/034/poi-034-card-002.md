Leo Busschau is remembered for his remarkable marksmanship, a skill he learnt with the Cadets in Koch Street and honed in the military. For many years coached the Cadets at Observatory. In 1937 he was sent a telegram from the King congratulating his winning the King’s Prize at Bisley (a shooting competition); he was afforded a civic reception by the City of Johannesburg and carried through the streets on a chair for all to congratulate his success.  Peter Busschau’s nephew, Jack Busschau, was a learner at Koch Street and Observatory. Jack’s son, Christopher Busschau, first attended Marist College in Port Elizabeth and then St David’s Inanda. Christopher Busschau’s three sons attended St. David’s and his grandson currently does. Christopher Busschau is Treasurer of the alumni association at St David’s. The Busschaus may have the first family alumni connection to the Marist schools in Johannesburg but they are by no means unique in this regard.
