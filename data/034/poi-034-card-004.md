Rebecca, who was in O’Leary House, was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Grade 8. She had chemotherapy for three years and, whilst in remission, excelled in her Matric. Her peers elected her LLC President for 2012. During 2013, while at UCT reading law, the leukemia returned. Rebecca had a stem cell and bone marrow transplant, funding for which was part raised by the wider Sacred Heart Community. The transplant appeared successful but in 2015 leukemia was rediscovered in Rebecca’s blood. That year Rebecca passed away; her funeral was held at the College.
