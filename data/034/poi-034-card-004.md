Rebecca, a member of O’Leary house, was academically gifted and, respected by her peers and staff alike, was elected to LLC President in Grade 12. Rebecca, diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Grade 8 underwent chemotherapy for three years. She exceled in her Matric, winning a place at UCT to read Law. During 2013, at UCT, it was discovered that the Leukemia had returned. Rebecca underwent a stem cell and bone marrow transplant, funding for which was part-raised by the wider Sacred Heart Community. Though it appeared that the transplant had been successful, sadly, in 2015 Leukemia was rediscovered in Rebecca’s blood. In May 2015 Rebecca passed away and her funeral was held at Sacred Heart.
