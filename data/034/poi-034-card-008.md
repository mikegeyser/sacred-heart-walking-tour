Simpiwe Tshabalala was one of the first black children to start at Sacred Heart College, in 1978. His presence then at the College, along with that of other black students, angered the provincial and national authorities and threats to close the school were issued by the Administrator of the Transvaal, at the time, Sybrand van Niekerk. 

In a speech given in 2011 at the College Sacred Heart, Tshabalala said:
> “I will never forget how warmly this school welcomed a young boy from Soweto, how caringly I was nurtured while I was here, and how much Sacred Heart has shaped the man I have become… Sacred Heart has always been well known for producing people who are adept at functioning in multicultural and diverse environments. Long may this continue.”
