Simpiwe Tshabalala, who was in Benedict House, started Sacred Heart College in Standard 3 (grade 5) in 1978. He was one of the first black children admitted by the school. His matric profile in the 1985 College Yearbook listed Spooks’s (his nickname at school) activities as cricket, rugby, soccer, public speaking, debating, waterpolo and swimming. His ambition, he stated, was the law. Tshabalala went on to study law at Rhodes University.  His yearbook entry ended with a quote; ‘Let me follow them, I am their leader’ (attributed both to Gandhi and French philosopher Ledru-Rollin, a contemporary of Champagnat).  

In the 1990s Sim Tshabalala joined the College’s Board of Governors and in this capacity, in 2000, gave a speech at the College around its identity and direction, alongside Nelson Mandela and Brother Neil. In 2011, again speaking at College whilst encouraging Sacred Heart College learners to become ‘transformers’ of wider society, Tshabalala stated:
> “I will never forget how warmly this school welcomed a young boy from Soweto, how caringly I was nurtured while I was here, and how much Sacred Heart has shaped the man I have become… Sacred Heart has always been well known for producing people who are adept at functioning in multicultural and diverse environments. Long may this continue.”
