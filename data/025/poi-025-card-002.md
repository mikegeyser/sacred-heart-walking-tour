The ‘March On’ tradition continues to this day as part of the Inter-House Athletics meet in September. Athletics has always been one of the major sports at the College, with all learners taking part, at whatever level is suited to their ability. Brother Callixte was recognised by the South African Athletics Union for his contribution to the sport in the early 1900s, and was made a life member due to Koch Street producing so many talented athletes, despite having no facilities of their own (when Observatory was built the boys travelled there to use them). Many South African athletes learnt their early skills on this cinder track, which was sprinkled with sawdust so it could be used after rains. Today the track is grass and the College continues to produce athletes who compete nationally.
