The tradition of the ‘March On’ for both inter-house athletics and swimming galas goes back to the beginning days at Observatory as evidenced in this photograph and most likely came as an ‘imported’ tradition from Koch Street when the boys used to ‘march to’ The Wanderers and Union Grounds to use sports facilities. Pre 1975, the Cadet Band in full military regalia with mace, drums and bugles would lead the school in a march to the strains of “Marching to Georgia” and “A hunting we will go” to t inter-house events. The band accompaniment came to an end when the Cadets were phased out and a Sousa march was played out from the loudspeakers instead as is still the case today, along with music of the moment as selected by the matrics of that year.
