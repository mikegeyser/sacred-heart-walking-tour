The picture above shows an athletics meet from the late 1940s and the smoke from the starting gun is visible. Brother Mario recalls an incident during the 1960s in which Br Andrew, who came from Inanda to prepare for an inter school swimming gala, was preparing the starting gun for use. Convinced that the selected ammunition was blank, he demonstrated by taking aim at a 44-gallon drum positioned at time on one of the traffic islands in front of the College, inside which was a garden hose. The hosepipe thereafter became a very long sprinkler system and for safety measures it was decided that the starting gun in swimming galas would be replaced with a whistle. The gun has been retained only for athletics â€“ and only blanks are kept on site!
