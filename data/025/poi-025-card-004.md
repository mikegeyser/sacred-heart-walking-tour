The College War Cry goes back at least to the 1940s, if not before. The boys imitated what was prevalent in society at the time and war cries were (and are) not unique to Sacred Heart College. However, each school’s war cry is unique but unfortunately the origins of the wording to Sacred Heart’s are unknown. The school’s official war cry is called ‘Rammy, Rammy, Ramson’:
 
Leaders: Rammy, Rammy, Ramson
Response: Ramson
Leaders: Rusting Culi Ruli Ra
Response: Ra Ra Ra
Leaders: Bulwa Bulwa Wa Wa Wa
Response: Roger, Roger Rika Ra
Leaders: Gee Whiz
Response: Wa Brothers
Leaders and Responders alternate shouting out letters: O-B-S-E-R-V-A-T-O-R-Y
