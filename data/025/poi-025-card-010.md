Soccer’s resurgence in popularity coincided with the teaching career of Micky Lill at Sacred Heart College. Lill had played in the English Premier League (Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves), West Ham, Everton and England Under 23), but had been forced to abandon a further professional career due to injury – which led him to coaching, and to South Africa. By 1986 the sport had fostered enough enthusiasm amongst both the boys and staff (though to the horror of many Old Boys) that it came to replace rugby as the main winter sport, and the 1st XV rugby pitch (behind the Science Block) was returned to its originally designated usage as a soccer field. The soccer teams received the benefit of coaching by retired professional Lill. Today this field is known, as it has been for the last thirty years, as “Old Trafford”, its goalposts made in the school workshop by Joseph Letebele. Soccer remains the main winter boys’ sport today and Sacred Heart College continues to produce excellent players who compete at District and Provincial levels. A number of alumni have played or are playing in professional leagues. Waseem Jadean (Matric 2014), former Kaizer Chiefs Academy member, is a professional soccer player in Malta for FC Gujdha. Emmanuel Ndlovu (Matric 2015), a former Black Aces Academy player, is part of a Greek professional club. Obert Rukato and Bogosi Morojele (2015 Matrics) play for Corinthians FC in the SAB Ekhuruleni League.
