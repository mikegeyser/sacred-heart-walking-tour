War cries had their origins in military ‘war cries’ – in the 1880s British soldiers were noted 
for having imitated the Usuthu war cries of the Zulu soldiers which declarations of war towards their opponents. Cultures all over the world and throughout history are renowned for this pre-empt to battle – from Nordic Vikings to Japanese Samurai. Shouting in a loosely musical form, like yelling is often a warning of strength or dominance or even a precursor to physical violence. It’s not unique to humans; think of the lion’s roar! 

Of course, the war cry is not a prelude to outbursts of violence at the College - a war cry in a civilian sense is understood as a cue to rally around a particular cause. The 1999 SRC report stated that a weekly war cry practice was introduced by the ‘Spirit Committee’ to teach the war cries and promote school spirit – for until the mid 1980s every boy knew the lyrics as it was regularly chanted at rugby matches by the crowd by way of encouragement to the players. In 2011 the LLC coined the practices ‘War Cry Wednesday’ and the cries can be heard at swimming galas and athletics fixtures, at the end of special assemblies and other spirit raising events today.
