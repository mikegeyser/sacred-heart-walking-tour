When the College opened to boys in 1926 several cricket fields were laid out, having been blasted flat and cleared of granite rocks by Brother Henry and his maintenance team. In 1940 the College Cricket Oval was created and turf wickets laid; the existing Kikuyu grass was removed and Magennis grass was planted. In 1941 the Oval was opened in the presence of the Mayor, Lady Mayoress, several City Councilors and a number of Old Boys (including Springbok cricketers Syd Curnow and C.N. Frank).
