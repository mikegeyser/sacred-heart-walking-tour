The Transvaal FA was formed in 1889 and not only did the boys at Koch Street play soccer in school as their main winter sport but, together with the Old Boys they formed their own A.F.C (Association Football Club) which played league matches within the Transvaal FA. Marist Brothers (and there was an equivalent Marist team in the Western Province) dominated the league until the 1960s and the advent of professional soccer. In 1955, Marist Brothers (in the Transvaal FA) won 19 trophies, including every league championship title in the province from Under 14 to the senior Transvaal League - an all-time record.  As of 1974 10% of Springbok Soccer players were old boys from Marist schools in South Africa. 

Sacred Heart College at Koch Street, and at Observatory, were renowned for their soccer teams and their reputation as leaders in the sport. The early impetus for likely came from Scottish immigrants to South Africa, who influenced by Brother Walfrid, an Irish Marist Brother who founded the famous Celtic Football Club in Glasgow (as a poverty outreach project in the 1880s) sought Marist schools for their soccer playing sons. Indeed, the Brothers, though many enjoyed the sport of rugby and taught it, were known for their preference for soccer as a socially unifying and accessible game.
