For fifty years at Sacred Heart College, soccer was replaced by rugby as the main sport. The boys also viewed it as a secondary sport. From the 1980s it regained popularity, perhaps due to its following amongst the newly admitted black students for whom soccer had always been a major game and in 1982 the school officially recognised a senior team who represented the College against other schools in matches. Today there are both girls’ and boys’ Soccer teams. 

The 1934 Maristonian noted the move to rugby with the following words::

> “King Soccer's long reign at the College has come to an end, and this may be well termed its obituary notice. Its term of sovereignty has been a long and an honourable one, and has left an indelible mark upon the history of the game in the Transvaal and in South Africa. Some of the most famous players who have represented this country have received their first coaching while at the School, among these perhaps the best known being Jock Ritchie, Freddie Mitchell and the Lowe brothers. Its passing will be regretted by many who almost regard the Marist Brothers' College and Soccer as inseparable, but factors beyond the control of the Brothers have made the change to rugby unavoidable. The latter has, however, been set a standard to reach and a tradition to equal.”
