Along with an alumni of Marist College in Uitenhage, Sir Quentin Brand, Air Vice Marshall Saunders was one of two Old Boys involved in the Battle of Britain in 1942\. In WW1 he was awarded the M.C (Military Cross) for gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving on horseback. In WW2 he transferred to the air force and 1943 he was awarded a CBE in recognition of his services, which entitled him to use the title ‘Sir’. He retired from the armed forces in 1953 as Air Vice Marshall, one of the highest possible military rankings and he died in 1987\.
