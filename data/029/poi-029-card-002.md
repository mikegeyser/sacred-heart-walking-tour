The springbok sits atop the ceremonial mace, still kept by Sacred Heart College, along with the Cadet Corps ceremonial sword, that was used by the Marist Brothers Cadet Corps. It would have been used at military inspections, pageants and for drills.

The mace is made of a dark wood, perhaps mahogany, with silver plating and measures 150 cm in length.
