This plaque found in the school hall is a memorial to Koch Street Old Boys who died in service during WW1 (1914-1918). The plaque was erected by the Old Boys Association in memory of their peers. There are 49 names listed and it is emblazoned with the Marist International crest and two springboks, the symbol used by South African soldiers in WW1. The Koch Street exam records list every boy who sat for Matriculation. G. Adler, the first alphabetically listed, was a Matric in 1910. A. Freedman, Matric 1911; A. Rennie, Matric 1912. The 1912 Maristonian describes some of its Old Boys; G.O.Veit who was born in 1890 (thus between 24 and 28 when he was killed in action) as a solicitor who still enjoyed cricket and hockey. Each one of the 49 will have been recorded in school annals; mentioned here are but four. The year in which they sat Matric serves as a stark reminder of the youths that these 49 Marist boys were when they were killed in action.
