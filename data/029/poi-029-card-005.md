Flight Lieutenant Samuel Marcus Kinkead R.N.A.S, D.F.C Bar, D.S.C Bar and D.S.O, born in 1897, was a matriculant at Koch Street in 1911\. After leaving Sacred Heart College, S.M. Kinkead trained with the R.F.C and became a highly skilled fighter pilot during WW1 and speed aviator afterwards. He died during an attempt to break the world record for the fastest ever recorded seaplane flight in 1928.

S.M.Kinkeadâ€™s elder brother, Thompson Calder Kinkead, also an alumnus of Sacred Heart at Koch Street, was killed during WW1 in a flying accident in 1917\. Second Lieutenant T.C.Kinkead is remembered as one of the 49 names on the WWI memorial plaque.
