> 'Ordained a priest in 1816, I was assigned to a town in the district of St.-Chamond (Loire). What I saw with my own eyes in that new post, with reference to the education, reminded me of the difficulties I had experienced myself at their age, for lack of teachers.'

Champagnat envisioned a brotherhood to tend to the educational and spiritual needs of children. Champagnat also employed a lay teacher at La Valla to support his teaching whilst he trained the two first Brothers. By the time of his death in 1840, only 23 years after the founding of the Marist Brothers, there were 278 Brothers in 48 schools.  In 2015 there were c.3,250 Brothers and c.70,000 lay people/teachers associated with the Marist congregation, as well as c.655,000 children. This window was added to the school Chapel in 2003, funded by a donation, specifically marked for a further Champagnat window.
