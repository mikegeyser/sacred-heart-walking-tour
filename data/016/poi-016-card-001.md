Champagnat’s experience with the Montagne boy confirmed his calling to teach the children in the rural areas of his parish. Within a few months of the boy’s death Champagnat had found two men willing to train as teachers and to follow in the way of Mary – with them Champagnat, curate the village of La Valla, started a school and a foundation house (part monastery and part teacher training college) for the newly founded congregation of Marist Brothers on 2 January 1817\. The original foundation house soon became too small and Notre Dame de L’Hermitage (depicted in bottom right of window as a red roofed building) was built in 1825 to accommodate 100 Brothers.

This window was gifted to the school chapel on the occasion of then pupil, Ricardo Louriero’s, First Holy Communion (1998) in 2000 by his family. Also of interest is the Champagnat signature copied from Champagnat’s own handwritten letters. The violets – a tiny but strongly fragrant flower - symbolise the three quiet virtues espoused by the Marist tradition, humility, simplicity, and modesty. The three nails allude not only to the crucifixion but also to the trade plied by the Marist Brothers in their early days, that of making nails. The largest nearby town, St Etienne, was (and remains) a center for metalwork.
