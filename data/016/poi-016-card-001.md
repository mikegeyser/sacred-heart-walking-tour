Champagnat’s experience with the Montagne boy confirmed his calling to teach children, particularly those who didn’t know God’s love. Within a few months of the boy’s death, Champagnat had found two men willing to train as teachers and to follow in the way of Mary. Champagnat, curate of the village of La Valla, started a school and a foundation house for the three of them on 2 January 1817. The original house soon became too small and Notre Dame de L’Hermitage (depicted at bottom right of window as a red roofed building) was completed in 1825 to accommodate 100 Brothers.

Also visible is Champagnat’s signature, copied from his own handwriting. The violets – a tiny but strongly fragrant flower – symbolise the three virtues espoused by the Marist tradition, humility, simplicity, and modesty. The three nails allude to the crucifixion and the trade plied by the Marist Brothers in their early days, making nails. Their nearby town, St Etienne, was (and remains) a centre for metalwork. This window was gifted in 2000 by the Louriero family to celebrate their son Ricardo’s First Holy Communion in 1998.
