Champagnat’s experience with the Montagne boy confirmed his calling to teach children, particularly those who didn’t know God’s love. Within a few months of the boy’s death Champagnat had found two men willing to train as teachers and to follow in the way of Mary. Champagnat, curate the village of La Valla, started a school and a foundation house for the three of them, on 2 January 1817. The original house soon became too small and Notre Dame de L’Hermitage (depicted in bottom right of window as a red roofed building) was built in 1825 to accommodate 100 Brothers.

Also visible is Champagnat signature copied from Champagnat’s own handwriting. The violets – a tiny but strongly fragrant flower - symbolise the three virtues espoused by the Marist tradition, humility, simplicity, and modesty. The three nails allude to the crucifixion and the trade plied by the Marist Brothers in their early days, making nails. Their nearby town, St Etienne, was (and remains) a center for metalwork. This window was gifted to the school chapel on the occasion of then pupil, Ricardo Louriero’s, First Holy Communion (1998) in 2000 by his family.
