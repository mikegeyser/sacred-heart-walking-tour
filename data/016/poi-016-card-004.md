Ravery’s portrait is a likeness of Champagnat since it was painted immediately after Champagnat’s death from cancer on 6th June 1840 (celebrated as Champagnat Day by the Marist communities). Ravery, who had painted several paintings for the chapel at L’Hermitage, was called to paint the deceased who had been washed, dressed in his cassock, stole and surplice and placed with his profession cross in his right hand on a sofa in his room. Champagnat, who died well before photography was widely accessible and was not painted in life, considered (as many religious people did previously) that sitting for a portrait was a demonstration of pride or of unnecessary luxury and as such something to be avoided. 

All later portraits and representations of Champagnat, including Ridolfi’s and Goyo’s (the latter was commissioned specially for the Canonisation in 1999) are artistic interpretations of this painting and as such attempt to portray something of the spiritual legacy that Champagnat created.
