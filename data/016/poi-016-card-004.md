The Beatification of Champagnat was proclaimed by Pope Pius XII on 29 May 1955; from then Champagnat was afforded the title of the 'Blessed' Marcellin Champagnat. Artist Tito Ridolfi was commissioned to paint an official portrait of Champagnat for this event, but he lost his sight during work on the piece and as it was unfinished, the portrait was never officially released by the Marist Brothers. The Provincial House portrait is very similar to Ridolfi’s portrait, bar the positioning of Champagnat’s hands and the lighter overall colourings used. In the Chapel, a portrait painted in 1948 by Br Dominguez Garcia at Sacred Heart, combines the hand positioning of Ridolfi’s portrait with the lighter colourings seen in this painting. To celebrate the 1955 event, pupils from Sacred Heart (both Koch Street and Observatory) and from St David’s attended a special Pontifical Mass at City Hall.
