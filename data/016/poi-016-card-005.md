The chalice of Marcellin Champagnat is gold and silver plated and measures approx. 15 x 30 cms. It is boxed in its original casing along with Champagnat’s patten. Engraved with “Calice du Vénérable Père Champagnac [sic]” at the base. Translated as ‘Chalice of the Venerable Father Champagnat’.

Champagnat’s chalice was brought to South Africa by Rev Br Justinian from the General House (then located in Grugliasco, northern Italy) around the time of Champagnat’s Beatification in 1955\. Rev Br Justin, a former Principal of Obs who at the time was Assistant General of the Marist Brothers arranged for its transportation in time for the dedication of the Memorial Chapel in 1956 and is kept by the Marist Brothers under lock and key. Br Jude Pieterse (former Provincial) suggests that Br Justinian was granted this request because South Africa was the first country that the Marists established schools in outside of Europe.

This chalice is mainly used for special occasions at the three Johannesburg Marist schools such as First Holy Communions, Confirmations and at special masses like those on Champagnat Day in June, but on occasion travels elsewhere in the Province of Southern Africa for similarly significant events.
