In 1999, Goyo painted this portrait in acrylic on a wood panel measuring 70 x 50cm. Goyo was a Marist pupil from the age of 10, and a later a Brother in Spain. Though he left the institution, he has kept close relations with the Marists. Many of his other paintings that feature Champagnat hang in Marist schools in Spain, and he remains a part of the Marist family in faith and friendship. In the late 1990s, Goyo was asked to create a new portrait of Champagnat to be used for the Canonisation of St Marcellin in 1999. Canonisation changed Champagnat’s appellation, and level of recognition by the Vatican, to Saint Marcellin Champagnat. A large version of Goyo's portrait, printed on canvas, was displayed in St Peter’s Basilica, Rome, when Champagnat was canonised in 1999. A print of this portrait can be found, amongst other places around the school, hanging in the main school reception hall.
