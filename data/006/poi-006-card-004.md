Camera Club was run by Brother Rudolf, a keen amateur photographer and the College Science teacher (and Principal, 1965-71). The club used the College darkroom which was situated in the science laboratories to develop their photographs, for of course this was long before the digital era. N. Bartie’s photograph was selected to appear in the 1963 school magazine, then called The Maristonian.
