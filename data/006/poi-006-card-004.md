This extra-mural was run by Brother Rudolf, a keen amateur photographer and the College Science teacher (and Principal 1965-71). The club used the College darkroom which was situated in the science laboratories to develop their photographs for this was way before the time of digital photography. N.Bartie’s photograph was selected to appear in the school magazine, then called The Maristonian in the 1963 edition.
