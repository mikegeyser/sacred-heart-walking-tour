Joseph Letebele also repaired the metal gates after a motorist mistook the closed gates for a side street in the 1990s. A little bend remains today, but straightening it further would necessitate the replacement of the whole gate. As it is, it serves as a reminder to pay close attention while driving in and out. 

The College gates were not locked at night until the late 1980s. An incident in 1987 led to this policy being revised. Information in the slides about the Statue of Jesus with the Sacred Heart explains what happened.
