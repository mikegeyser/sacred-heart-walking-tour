Until then, the gate was a single entry/exit passage but with increased motor traffic in the College this became restrictive. In 1978 a passing truck crashed into the gates, damaging some of the stone work. Brother Anton and Joseph Letebele took the opportunity to construct a double entry/exit gate to ease traffic flow. Each stone was taken down from the original gates and numbered, so that when the new and enlarged gates were built most of the stones could be repurposed in the correct places (e.g. cornerstones were still cornerstones). This was painstaking work, which took most of the year. You can still see the green lettering used to mark each stone on todayâ€™s gateposts.
