  text: "The Tower above the Main Quadrangle houses the water supply tank for the whole College. The College has two boreholes on the property, one of which dates back to the 1920s when the grounds were prepared for use as a school, and is located within the Workshop building itself. The pump has since been replaced but the hole has remained a plentiful source of water for the College to this day. Water from the two boreholes (the second is located on the top field) is combined with a municipal supply in this tower tank."

The image of the Tower was taken before the Main Quadrangle was renovated in the late 1990s. The piazza of the quadrangle was liable to flooding in heavy rains; the after effects of this can be seen in the lower right hand corner of the image.
