Joseph Letebele trained in carpentry at Pax College (Pietersburg) with the Brothers of Charity. Starting with a holiday job in July 1959, he was invited back for a probationary period as a handyman in 1961. From 1962, Joseph Letebele was permanently employed, as school Carpenter and “proved to be quite indispensable. He knows where every fuse is to be found, where every key fits, the intricacies of the swimming pool filter, the condition of every desk… the list is endless” (1989 College Yearbook).
