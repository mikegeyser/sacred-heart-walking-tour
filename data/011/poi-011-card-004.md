Joseph Letebele trained in carpentry at Pax College (Pietersburg) with the Brothers of Charity. His first contact with Sacred Heart College, or Marist Obs as it was known then, was through his father Ephraim Letebele, Boarders’ Chef from 1934 (until his retirement in 1974). Joseph had a holiday job in July 1959 and was invited back for a probationary period as a handyman in 1961. From 1962, as recorded in this Dompas above, he was permanently employed, as school Carpenter and “proved to be quite indispensable. He knows where every fuse is to be found, where every key fits, the intricacies of the swimming pool filter, the condition of every desk… the list is endless” (1989 College Yearbook).
