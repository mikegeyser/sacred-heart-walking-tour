Their design references the Sacred Heart of Jesus from where the College takes its name and to the love with which everything in the workshop is made or repaired. The Maintenance and Ground Staff, not all of whom are based in this building, are responsible for the cleaning, repair and upkeep of the College buildings and facilities. Their skills range from carpentry to welding, from tiling to landscaping, and from catering provision to security monitoring. As individuals they  are integral to the College community."

The College Workshop is situated in the building where the Boardersâ€™ Laundry and Ironing used to be done. The Workshop was originally in the northern basement of the main College building (where the printing room and school Nurse can be found) but the noise of the machinery in use during class time meant that it became necessary to find an alternative space. When a Laundry for the Boarders was no longer required the Workshop was moved from the basement to the Laundry building.
