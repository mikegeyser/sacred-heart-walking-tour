There are many interconnections between individuals involved in the struggles and the Sacred Heart Community that can be traced over many years. This picture offers an insight into just one of these stories. Walter Sisulu and Denis Goldberg were two of ten liberationists arrested during a raid at Liliesleaf and subsequently imprisoned after the Rivonia Trial in 1964. Though the meeting of Denis Goldberg and Walter Sisulu’s grandson took place in 2016, the foundations of this particular narrative can be traced back through Sacred Heart to 1913. 

In 1964 Joel Joffe was the attorney who took on defending the cases of Sisulu and Goldberg at the Rivonia Trial. Joffe was at ‘Obs’ and matriculated in 1948 with first class results. Bram Fischer, who was lead counsel of the defense team, chose to send his children to Sacred Heart College some years later. Nelson Mandela was convicted at the Rivonia Trial, having been found not guilty in the earlier Treason Trial of the 1950s. Many of his grandchildren attended Sacred Heart College. The leader of the Treason Trial defense team was Israel Maisels, perhaps better known as Isie Maisels Q.C., a Sacred Heart College (Koch Street) alumnus. Liliesleaf Farm was used as a hideout for many of those connected to the ANC and other liberationist movements whose workings had been strengthened in the wake of the Treason Trial’s outcome. It is fitting that Sacred Heart College learners visit this site, amongst others during school outings, to further their understanding of their community’s involvement in the transformative forces in South African society.
