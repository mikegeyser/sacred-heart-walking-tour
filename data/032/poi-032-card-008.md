There are many interconnections between individuals involved in the struggles and the Sacred Heart Community that can be traced over many years. This picture offers an insight into just one of these stories. Walter Sisulu and Denis Goldberg were two of ten liberation activists arrested during a raid at Liliesleaf and subsequently imprisoned after the Rivonia Trial in 1964. Though the meeting of Denis Goldberg and Walter Sisulu’s grandson took place in 2016, the foundations of this particular narrative can be traced back through Sacred Heart to 1913. 

The leader of the 1956 Treason Trial defence team was Israel Maisels, who started at Koch Street in 1913. Nelson Mandela, Sisulu and 154 others were charged with treason but were all found not guilty. In 1964 Joel Joffe, an ‘Obs’ alumnus, was one of the attorneys who defended Mandela, Sisulu and Denis Goldberg at the Rivonia Trial. A number of the Mandela and Sisulu grandchildren and great-grandchildren attended Sacred Heart College. Liliesleaf Farm was used as a hideout for leaders of the liberation struggle. It is fitting that Sacred Heart College learners visit this site to further their understanding of their community’s involvement in the struggle for freedom in South Africa.
