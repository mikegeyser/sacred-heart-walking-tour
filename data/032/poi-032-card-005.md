Both the cycle ride and the music festival were events organised to bring awareness to and conscientise around issues surrounding xenophobia. "

An 11-year-old pupil wrote of her fears and hopes during the outbursts of xenophobic violence in South Africa in April 2015\. The girl wrote an ‘Open Letter’ and asked her teacher at Sacred Heart College to help her spread her message; the letter subsequently went viral after it was posted by Colin Northmore on social media and sent in communications to the Sacred Heart College community encouraging awareness of and activating against xenophobic discriminations. SABC featured the letter in their news-coverage at the time, heightening the exposure her message needed to be effective and the letter was also reproduced for an exhibition and in the school yearbook. The pupil, who used a pseudonym while writing, also read the letter at a youth rally held in June of that year at Constitution Hill. Here you can hear her read her own words.

Sacred Heart College, in the thirty years after the shift towards transformation that was activated in 1976, evolved driven by Marist principles to evidence a diverse sanctuary-like school and microcosm of the positive possibilities of South African society. This is demonstrated through this letter written by one of its learners.
