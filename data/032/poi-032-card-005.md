During the late 1970s and 1980s Sacred Heart College was undergoing a period of transformation. Not only did the school begin to admit pupils other than white boys by first becoming an Open school and then Co-Educational (the latter was not only done to consolidate three schools but also as part of a conscious move to destabilise the male-centric nature of the school and imbalances of power that were reflected in the apartheid regime (the disbanding of the Cadets and the de-structuring of the Prefect System were examples of this) that the college were moving away from. College Principal, Brother Neil McGurk and Brother Jude Pieterse (then Secretary General of SACBC and Chairperson of the SA Catholic Schools Association) were not only influential in the transformation of the school but also in the nationâ€™s forthcoming socio-political transformations, particularly in the area of educational reforms. Both men were integral to negotiations with the Government, specifically in talks with the then Administrator of the Transvaal, Sybrand Van Niekerk and the Minister of National Education, Piet Koornhoff. These talks revealed the divisions beginning to appear within the apartheid regime surrounding principles of inclusion in education, with the Brothers offering Catholic principles of inclusivity as a basis for educational reform supported by international opinion regarding segregation in South Africa and concluding with discussions of how moving against the Open Schools would further damage international relations in the wake of Soweto, the death of Steve Biko and the cultural boycott.
