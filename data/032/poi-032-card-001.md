  text: "The plaque on the front door of the Marist Provincial Offices reads ‘I will bless every place where a picture of my heart shall be exposed and honored’ around an image of Jesus with Sacred Heart. Eric Molobi, struggle activist, was given refuge at the College in the 1980s. An identical plaque was affixed to the door of his room."

Sacred Heart College inspires and demands a social consciousness that reflects on and actively seeks practical ways to move forward through the complexity of South African society. Though the College ethos is undoubtedly underpinned by Catholic (specifically Marist) principles, it draws from many cultures and faiths (Islam and Hinduism in particular, since a large number of the school community come from these traditions). Shared values and a deep sense of justice and equality knit together community members into a common order, expressed through love and mutual respect. In fact, it is often most precisely because of the diversity within the Sacred Heart community that traditional values are honed and shared, because each member can reflect on the common threads of humanity that bind them to each other. 

The narratives in these slides are by no means a comprehensive collection of all the stories connected to individuals from Sacred Heart’s community who have actively contributed (and continue to contribute) towards positive change within society and to transformative dialogue around socio-political issues. Herewith is a selection of some of them.
