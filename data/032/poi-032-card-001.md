The same plaque is also affixed above the door to the room where Eric Molobi stayed whilst being given refuge at the College during the 1980s. "

Particularly between 1976-1996 but throughout the years that followed (and still ongoing) Sacred Heart College inspires and demands a social consciousness that reflects around and actively seeks practical ways to move forward through the complexity of South African society. Though at Sacred Heart the ethos is undoubtedly underpinned by Christian (specifically Marist) principles, it is the richness in and appreciation of a shared spirituality expressed through love and mutual respect that draws from many cultures and faiths (Islam and Hinduism in particular since a large number of the school community come from these traditions) and from those with a deep sense of morality expressed through shared values that knit together community members into a common order. In fact, it is often most precisely because of the diversity within the Sacred Heart community that traditional values are honed and shared because each member can reflect on the common threads of humanity that bind them to each other.

The information that is included in this POI (walking tour stop) is by no means a comprehensive collection of all the stories connected to individuals from Sacred Heart’s community who have contributed (and continue to contribute) towards positive change within in and to transformative dialogue around socio-political issues. Herewith a selection of some of the stories associated with the activists from Sacred Heart’s congregation.
