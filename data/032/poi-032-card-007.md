The College provides a balanced, multicultural and dynamic environment. Confidence is instilled in the individual through allowing no single pupil grouping to dominate; no sporting, academic or cultural merits are ranked more important than others. The Marist ethos cultivates proactivity around the values of equality and freedom. The development of critical thinking skills, through an ever-innovating curriculum, produces well balanced, respectful but equally opinionated and strong willed alumni; something which is often remarked on by those meeting alumni in the fields of further education and business. That many of the leaders in the 2015 and 2016 protests around access to education and its fee structures were alumni of Sacred Heart College came as no surprise. Rekgotsofetse Chikane (pictured) and Wits SRC Secretary General for 2016, Fasiha Hassan (matric 2011), are but two examples; many others, including some of the older students still attending the College, also stepped forward to demonstrate their solidarity with the cause. 

Rekgotsofetse Chikane, who in his final year at Sacred Heart was president of the Learners’ Representative Council, is the son of Rev. Frank Chikane. Frank Chikane first associated with the school in 1971 when he came from Soweto to Observatory for extra Saturday lessons to boost his tuition before his matriculation exams that year. In 1988, Frank Chikane, like Eric Molobi, was given refuge by the Marists when he was being sought by the Security Police at the Holy Family Convent in Yeoville, by then a satellite premises for Sacred Heart. The property was raided and paper bombed on the same night that Sacred Heart’s statue of Jesus was necklaced, but Chikane was not found. Later, however, Frank Chikane was subjected to a near-fatal poisoning, which he spoke about at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
