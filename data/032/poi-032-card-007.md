There are many interconnections between individuals involved in the struggles, some of which continue to this day, and the Sacred Heart Community that can be traced over many years. This picture offers an insight into just one of these stories.

Though the meeting of Denis Goldberg and Walter Sisulu’s grandson took place in 2016, the foundations of this particular narrative can be traced back through Sacred Heart to 1913\.

In 1964 Joel Joffe was the attorney who took on defending the cases of Sisulu and Goldberg at the Rivonia Trial. Joffe was at ‘Obs’ and matriculated in 1948 with first class results. Bram Fischer, who was lead counsel of the defense team, chose to send his children to Sacred Heart College some years later. Nelson Mandela was also convicted at the Rivonia Trial, having been found not guilty in the earlier Treason Trial of the 1950s. The leader of the Treason Trial defense team was Israel Maisels, perhaps better known as Issy Maisels, as he was called by his peers and teachers, when he started at Koch Street in 1913\. Liliesleaf Farm was used as a hideout for many of those connected to the ANC and other liberationist movements whose workings had been strengthened in the wake of the Treason Trial’s outcome.
