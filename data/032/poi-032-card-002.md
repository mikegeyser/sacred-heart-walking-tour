Mr. Lowry, as a worker for the South African Catholic Bishopsâ€™ Conference (SACBC) and Mr. Molobi, were both been detained by the government during the 1980s. They were arrested because of their involvement in activities that promoted peace and justice during the years of the apartheid regime. During the 1970s Eric Molobi had been imprisoned on Robben Island for his work with the then-banned ANC. After his release Molobi, along with Sheila Sisulu, other community leaders and supported by the South African Council of Churches and the SACBC worked within two educationally focused activist groups; The Joint Enrichment Program (that dealt with civic leadership in townships and their school) and The National Education Crisis Committee. At the same time Molobi was administrator for the Kagiso Trust (that benefited black South Africans in the 1980s funded by the European Commission). Molobi later became CEO of the re-formed Kagiso Trust Investments from 1993 which continued to support and promote learning by young black South Africans once the new government took over.
