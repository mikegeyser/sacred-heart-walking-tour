The Hearts into the Future Cycle ride is held on Heritage Day, prior to the One Heart Music Festival. Both events are intended to bring awareness of issues surrounding xenophobia. An 11-year-old College learner wrote of her fears and hopes in an ‘Open Letter’ during the outbursts of xenophobic violence in South Africa in April 2015. The letter subsequently went viral after it was posted by Principal Colin Northmore on social media, encouraging awareness of and activating against xenophobic discriminations. SABC News circulated the learner’s message further. The pupil, who used a pseudonym while writing, read the letter at a youth rally held in June of that year at Constitution Hill and it can be heard here. The Sacred Heart College community remains driven by Marist principles, a diverse, sanctuary-like school and is a microcosm of the positive possibilities of South African society.
