In 1986 and 1987, Sacred Heart hosted talks between College and township students on the subject of schooling. In 1989, leaders from Sacred Heart College were included in the Five Freedoms Forum Delegation to meet with ANC leadership in Lusaka. As well as discussing the suspension of armed struggle, questions around the school enrolment of the exiles’ children and grandchildren were addressed, assuming an imminent return. Many of those children later enrolled at the College. Into the early 1990s the Sacred Heart teaching community, in conjunction with the Brothers, attended to local and national issues surrounding the rapidly changing socio-economic demographic of central Johannesburg, and were instrumental in the setting up of Model D schools – ensuring educational provision for black pupils, training for teachers from the black community, and continued employment for teachers from the white community.
