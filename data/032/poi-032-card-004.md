In 1986 and 1987 Sacred Heart was the scene of talks between college students and those from the townships around the subject of schooling. By 1989 leaders from Sacred Heart College were included in the Five Freedoms Forum Delegation to meet with ANC leadership in Lusaka; as well as discussion of suspension of armed struggle and broader issues the enrolment the ANC’s leader’s children and grandchildren in school was arranged, assuming an imminent return from exile. On their return, many of the children enrolled at the College. Into the early 1990s the Sacred Heart teaching community, in conjunction with the Brothers, attended to local and national issues surrounding the rapidly changing socio-economic demographic of central Johannesburg and were instrumental in the setting up of Model D schools - ensuring educational provision for black pupils and continued employment for teachers from the white community as well as training for teachers from the black community.
