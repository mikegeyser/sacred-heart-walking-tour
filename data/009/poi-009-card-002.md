In the archive there is no date associated with this picture; however, due to the absence of a statue in the front niche (above the main steps) and the height of the trees it can be estimated at c.1930-1931.

The Orchard was a private area in the College grounds for use of the Brothers and was given the name of ‘crows’ garden’ by the boys.

Edward Joffe, matric c. 1948, in his book, Before Mandela’s Rainbow, recalled:

> “Facing the College’s main buildings across the driveway stood an orchard the size of a soccer field, entry to which was absolutely forbidden. Few foolhardy lads had ever courted disaster by entering that sanctuary where the Brothers meditated, enjoyed a quiet drag, or simply escaped to take respite from their charges”

Frank Hollingworth, staff member since 1979, recalls that one pupil who had been at ‘Obs’ in the 1950s told him he was very disappointed on joining the school to find out that the boys were not allowed to enter, for it had been one of the reasons he had asked his parents to send him to Obs in the first place – in the hope of fresh fruit on demand!
