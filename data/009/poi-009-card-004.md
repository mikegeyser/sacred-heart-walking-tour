This image shows how densely planted the Orchard was at its peak (at the top of this picture) and it remained like this until the late 1980s. It also gives a sense of the heart-shape that the Orchard became with the extra planting on the side towards Eckstein street (the road visible to the left of the photograph). From this view (east to west) the top of the earlier plume shaped orchard is to the top right in the picture.
