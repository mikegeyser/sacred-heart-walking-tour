This image shows how densely planted the Orchard was at its peak (at the top of this picture) and it remained like this until the late 1980s. It also gives a sense of the heart shape that the Orchard became with the extra planting on the side towards Eckstein Street (the road visible to the left of the photograph). From this view (east to west) the top of the earlier plume-shaped orchard is to the top right in the picture.

Brother Henry, one of the aforementioned botany enthusiasts, was also responsible for making a substantial part of the College grounds that are visible in this picture accessible. In the 1920s he obtained a Blasters License from the Department of Mines and used this to blast the rocky, iron-containing outcrops of the Observatory area, in particular the koppies that covered the area now known as the Orchard and the sports fields. Some of the stone was reused to form boundary walls, terracing and steps around the College.
