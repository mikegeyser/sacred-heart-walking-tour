Cedar Avenue was the name given to the pathway around the perimeter of the orchard. Cedar Avenue exists today as the pathway that runs between the Pre Primary school and the open area in the orchard, down to the western perimeter of the College grounds. From the 1931 image (card 1) you can make out original the plume shape of the planting, however by the 1950s further planting on the south side of the orchard had extended the orchard into a heart shaped area. The ‘plume’ was thus the left hand side of the heart viewed from the west towards the east (the direction of the photograph in card 1).
