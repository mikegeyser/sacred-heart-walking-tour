During 2014 and 2015 some of the trees needed to be felled to maintain the overall health of the Orchard area. The wood from these trees was kept to be repurposed by the pupils during Mindworks (a biannual programme for the Primary school run by the parent body engaging the learners in skills not usually timetabled in the regular curriculum). The painted stumps are used for games, outdoor furniture and in one corner, a bug hotel. Other Mindworks and Arts-Festival programs (the High School equivalent to Mindworks) have included the creation of murals, the mosaic works seen in the High School and Intermediate quads, as well as the clay-hands Vertical Garden on the side of the High school art room. One year a Labyrinth was created in the Orchard and is maintained for use by the pupils during break times.
