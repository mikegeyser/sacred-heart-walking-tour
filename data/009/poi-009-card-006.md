Today the Orchard is used by all sections of the school and for a wide range of reasons. During term time, it is used daily as a grassy and shaded play area at break time, except on rainy days. The Three2Six children congregate in the Orchard on arrival at school before they go off to class and a selection of extra-murals takes place in its four corners. Primary aftercare is supervised here, and after school, all ages (students, staff and parents) know itâ€™s the place to find Sammy the ice-cream seller.

Other Marist and school community happenings take place in the Orchard throughout the year; the Stations of the Cross is led around the Orchard by the Brothers on Good Friday and Carols by Candlelight is held in December.
