Today The Orchard is used by all sections of the school and for a wide range of reasons. Daily during term time, unless it’s raining, it is used as a grassy and shaded play area at break time. The Three2Six children congregate in the Orchard on arrival at school before they go off to class and a selection of extra-murals take place in its four corners. Primary aftercare is supervised here and after school, all ages (students, staff and parents) know it’s the place to find Sammy the ice-cream seller.

Other Marist and school community happenings take place in The Orchard throughout the year; the Stations of the Cross is led around the Orchard by the Brothers on Good Friday and Carols by Candlelight is held in December.
