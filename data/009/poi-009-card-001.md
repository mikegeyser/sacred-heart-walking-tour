The grounds were bordered by Norfolk pine trees planted by the Brothers at the outset of establishing the property, in consultation with the government’s forestry department.  The orchard was planted with fruit trees; peach and fig. The avenues in the orchard area were planted with cedar trees. 

Brother Henry, along with Brother Florian (the first College Principal) was responsible for establishing the gardens and trees. Br Florian was a botanist and landscaper, whilst Brother Henry looked after the plants and shrubs. Brother Henry established and tended a nursery for seedlings. The rectangular space at the top left of the orchard area was a vegetable patch from which fresh produce was procured for the dining room. Today a vegetable patch still exists in the Orchard, situated on the far western perimeter of the college grounds. 

In the top right of the image is a square area edged with pine trees that used to be part of the school grounds; today the two blocks of houses east of Steyn Street are built on this. This part of the grounds was left unleveled and was referred to as ‘the potato patch’ for it was covered in lumps of rock and mainly used by the Cadets until it was sold in 1953.
