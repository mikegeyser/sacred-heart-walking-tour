School grounds bordered by Norfolk pine trees planted by the Brothers at the outset of establishing the property, in consultation with the government’s forestry department. The orchard was planted with fruit trees; peach and fig. The avenues in the orchard area were planted with cedar trees.

Brother Henry, who along with Brother Florian (the first College Principal) was a keen botanist and they were both responsible for establishing the gardens and trees. Br Florian was known for his planning and landscaping, Br Henry for his tending to plants and shrubs. There was even a nursery for seedlings reported to have existed at the college in the early days.

The rectangular space at the top left of the orchard area was a vegetable patch from which fresh produce was procured for the dining room. Today a vegetable patch still exists in the Orchard but is now situated on the far western perimeter of the college grounds.
