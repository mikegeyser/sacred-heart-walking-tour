Brother Joseph, former Primary School Principal, recalled the final school assembly of 1993 when a prayer for peace was said by the whole school. It was said not in anticipation of unrest in the school but rather because it was a time of national uncertainty in the run up to the first democratically held elections in 1994.  This assembly and prayer was described by a visiting German journalist as expressing a spirit of the unity through diversity in the school community and showed hope for the country to develop in this way. The article was read by the Director of the Peace Pole Project (an international organization) who decided Sacred Heart would be a fitting location for a South African Peace Pole to be erected – to remind onlookers of the importance of peace in a location that has suffered disruption through human injustices.  

In 1994, in an elaborate ceremony which involved the whole school and members of the wider community, a peace pole was put up to the right hand side of the stage. On its four sides “May Peace Prevail On Earth” written in isiZulu, Afrikaans, Sesotho and English reminded observers of the message it stood for. After the quad was renovated some years later the pole was removed from its spot. One might guess that it has not been re-installed because the message of tolerance, unity and diversity has long been learnt at Sacred Heart.
