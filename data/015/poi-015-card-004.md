The Integrated Studies Curriculum was a concrete example of the innovative approach to education undertaken at Sacred Heart College. The school is underpinned by and strengthened through values that come directly from the unique application of Marcellin Champagnat’s educational vision and which lie at the core of Marist schools. These values can be understood as five pedagogical (or educational practice) pillars that uphold and inform the educational framework of the school. These five characteristics are named as presence, simplicity, family spirit, love of work and following the way of Mary. 
	
Mary, the mother of Jesus, is understood as the perfect model of the Marist educator. Faithful and loving she knew both the joys and the trials of life. In her way, Marist educators seek to lead by example and above all to encourage the personal growth of their learners by establishing relationships with them based on love and humility. The family spirit that is encouraged is evidenced in the relationships built between learners of all ages, supported by their teachers, through whom a strong community is built. This simple, modest attentiveness is something which sets apart the Marist and Sacred Heart Community from others – the nurturing of ‘doing good, quietly’ in a school setting encourages hard work, application and mindfulness.
