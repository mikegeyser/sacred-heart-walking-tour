In the final school assembly of 1993, when all learners were housed in the classrooms on the Observatory site (the Junior Primary learners moved from Yeoville in 1993), a prayer for peace was said by the whole school. It was a time of national uncertainty before the first democratic elections in the country in 1994. A visiting German journalist who witnessed the prayer described the spirit of the diverse and united school community as a beacon of hope for the country. The Director of the Peace Pole Project (an international organisation that began in Japan in the 1950s), after reading the article, decided the College would be a fitting location for a South African Peace Pole. 

The whole school and members of the wider community took part in an elaborate ceremony to put up a peace pole to the right of the stage area in 1994. On its four sides it read “May Peace Prevail On Earth” in isiZulu, Afrikaans, Sesotho and English. The quad was renovated some years later and the pole was removed. Perhaps it has not been re-installed because the message of tolerance, unity and diversity has long been learnt at Sacred Heart.
