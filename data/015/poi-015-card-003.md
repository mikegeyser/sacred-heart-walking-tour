In the final school assembly of 1993 and when the learners were housed in the classrooms on the Observatory site (having moved the Junior Primary learners from Yeoville in 1993), a prayer for peace was said by the whole school. It was said because It was a time of national uncertainty in the run up to the first democratically held elections in the country in 1994 (rather than in anticipation of unrest in the school after the addition of junior classes).  This whole school prayer for peace was written about by a visiting German journalist who described the spirit of the diverse and united school community as a way in which future hope for the country could be developed. This magazine article was read by the Director of the Peace Pole Project (an international organization that began in Japan in the 1950s) who decided that Sacred Heart would be a fitting location for a South African Peace Pole to be erected – one that attempts to remind onlookers of the importance of peace in a location that has suffered disruption through human injustices.  

From 1994, after an elaborate ceremony which involved the whole school and members of the wider community, a peace pole was put up to the right of the stage area. On its four sides it reads “May Peace Prevail On Earth” in isiZulu, Afrikaans, Sesotho and English to remind its observers of the message it stands for. After the quad was renovated some years later the pole was removed from its spot, and is now kept in the workshop. One might guess that it has not been re-installed because the message of tolerance, unity and diversity has long been learnt at Sacred Heart.
