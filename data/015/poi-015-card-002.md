All over the College grounds, in windows, on plaques, in the form of benches, artworks or dedicated spaces there are memorials to those members of the school community who have died. Many more of course are recalled through the memories of those who have attended or still attend the college without a physical marker in the grounds to their earthly existence. Each one, in their own way, made a special contribution to the family spirit of Sacred Heart College. 

This stained-glass window, created by artist Barry Thompson, who produced most of the windows in the Memorial Chapel, commemorates the life of Bebe Mothopeng 1982-2004. Bebe, a member of the Learners Leadership Council, matriculated from the College in 2001.  She was in the third year of her Bachelor of Education degree at UNISA, completing her teaching practice at Sacred Heart College, when she died in 2004 after a short illness. Like many members of her family, Bebe was a musician and had been a member of both the Soweto Youth Orchestra and the Johannesburg Youth Orchestra as a wind instrumentalist and sang as part of the Nightingale Childrenâ€™s Choir in her youth.
