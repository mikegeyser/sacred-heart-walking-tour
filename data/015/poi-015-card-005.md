This photograph, from the archive of Museum Africa, shows Sacred Heart College learners handing over gifts that had been collected for a relief-fund in 1932 during the worldwide economic depression, which also affected South Africa. A connection between the Rotary Club and Sacred Heart College remains to this day in joint efforts for charitable works. In 2016, the Rotary Club’s “Stop Hunger” food packing drive was assisted by High School learners and staff. 

The five Marist pillars include presence, love of work and family spirit. These characteristics are seen in many ways within the school community (e.g. the whole school supporting of the Three2Six education project) but also in connection with wider community projects. That charitable work is more than just a donation but involves presence, application (and fun!) can be seen in a number of projects that the children take part in like the yearly Red and White Days and Rollerblade Disco which raises funds for a local children’s home, or the collection of bottled water for national distribution during the droughts of 2015/2016.
