The Senior Primary Quad – or Intermediate Quad (Intermediate Phase is grades 4-6) was officially opened in the centenary year of the Marist Brothers arrival in Johannesburg, in March 1989. The foundation stone was unveiled by Mr K. O’Dowd, Chairman of Anglo American’s Chairman’s Fund, one of the main contributors to the funding of the new premises along with the De Beers Chairman’s Fund and the JCI Fund. The relationship between the sponsors and the school came through shared insights around educational development and provision at a national level. The Marist Brothers, College staff and wider community members together with representatives from these corporations held talks with the Department of Education that led to reinvestment in schooling, both in private schools like Sacred Heart College and in Model C and D schools in central Johannesburg in the late 1980s and early 1990s; a period of critical change.

At the time that the Senior Primary building was opened the school implemented an innovative curriculum of Integrated Studies for those in the bridging years of Primary and High school (grades 7 and 8). This was a consolidation of subject teaching, particularly in the social sciences, which provided a common focus on literacy, numeracy and language learning. It was a skills based and differentiated approach to accommodate learners from different educational and language backgrounds enabling them to learn together with those who had already benefited from Sacred Heart’s learning environment. The subject matter provided a balanced historical perspective and was taught in relation to real life experiences that encouraged interaction amongst the diverse student body.
