The Senior Primary, or Intermediate (grades 4-6) Quad was officially opened in March 1989, the centenary year of the Marist Brothers’ arrival in Johannesburg. The foundation stone was unveiled by Mr K. O’Dowd, Chairman of Anglo American’s Chairman’s Fund, one of the main funders of the new premises (along with the De Beers Chairman’s Fund and the JCI Fund). The relationship between the donors and the school came through shared insights around educational development and provision at a national level. The Marist Brothers, College staff and community members, together with representatives from these corporations, held talks with the Department of Education that led to reinvestment in schooling, both in private schools like Sacred Heart College and in Model C and D schools in central Johannesburg in the late 1980s and early 1990s; a period of critical change.

At the time of the Senior Primary Quad opening the school was implementing an innovative curriculum of Integrated Studies for those in the bridging years of Primary and High school (grades 7 and 8). This was a consolidation of subject teaching, particularly in the social sciences, which provided a common focus on literacy, numeracy and language learning, and was designed to accommodate and integrate learners from different educational and language backgrounds. The subject matter provided a balanced historical perspective and was taught in relation to real life experiences that encouraged interaction amongst the diverse student body.
