Pupils from three sections of the school (Three2Six, Pre-Primary and Primary) were involved in the creation of artwork for the Hospital that opened in late 2016. Charitable giving and works are an important part of the College’s community spirit. In the Pre-Primary weekly collections of extra packed lunches donated by families are passed onto a ‘meals on wheels’ service for the elderly and homeless. Older learners are encouraged to think of their own causes and ways in which to support them; examples of these are the pupil-led initiative by grade 5s in 2016 to hold their own ‘CEO SleepOut’ to raise funds for the destitute and the High School’s Enviro-Club and Eco Committee, which, in 2016 was awarded International Green Flag Status by Generation Earth (a US based environmental education program).
