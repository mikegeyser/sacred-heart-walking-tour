Charitable giving and works are an important part of the Sacred Heart College community spirit. This begins in the Pre-Primary where weekly collections of donated extra packed lunches are passed onto a ‘meals on wheels’ service for the elderly and homeless. Older learners are encouraged to support causes they select; examples of these are the 2016 grade 5s initiative to hold a ‘SleepOut’ to raise funds for the destitute, and the High School’s Enviro-Club and Eco Committee, awarded International Green Flag Status by Generation Earth (a US based environmental education programme) in 2016.
