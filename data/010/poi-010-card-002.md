Mary is traditionally represented wearing blue. Blue dye (ultramarine, made from crushed semi-precious stone lapis lazuli) was a very rare commodity in ancient times. It was associated with royalty and the wealthy and, as such, in religious pictures, a heavenly grace bestowed on the worthy. Some sources suggest that in the Middle East, where Mary came from, blue clothing was associated with virginity. Blue is the colour of the sky and heavens in Catholic tradition, and from where Jesus’s heavenly arrival was proclaimed. Mary’s cloak is edged with gold. Again, this colour refers to royalty and Mary is held to be the “Queen of Heaven”. Of course, blue and gold are the two colours chosen for the uniform of Sacred Heart College (and the other Marist schools in South Africa).
