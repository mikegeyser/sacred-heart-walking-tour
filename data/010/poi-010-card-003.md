As a black Madonna with child, the statue offers a representation of Mary fitting for Sacred Heart College’s inclusive and diverse community, that speaks to one of the pivotal moments in the calling of Marcellin Champagnat to his life’s work. It was before the black virgin, in the Chapel of Our Lady of Fouvière, that Champagnat and other newly ordained priests pledged to establish the Society of Mary in 1816. For Champagnat, Mary as mother – loving, faithful, giving and guiding - was the ultimate role model, and it is from the relationship between Mary and Jesus that Marist principles are derived. In turn, the ethos of Sacred Heart College is based on this.
