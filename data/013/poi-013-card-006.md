Wilfred Napier, President of the SACBC, in the preface to the booklet described the attack as “an attempt to destroy the commitment and the spirit of justice, love and truth that inspired the Southern African Bishops’ Conference in its opposition to apartheid”.

Brother Jude related that explosives (including limpet mines) were found in the building after the fire, the planting of which he explained, was most likely intended to extended the damaged caused in the fire.

> “What has occurred at Khanya House is a tragedy, not only for the Bishops’ Conference but for the country as well. THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR POLITICAL POINT SCORING. It is a time for all South Africans to realise that violence will not solve the problems of the country. The Bishops’ Conference remains committed to seeking a peaceful solution to the problems of our country”

The attack on Khanya House was the third similar of incident that year. Previously that year Cosatu House, the Trade Union Headquarters and Khosto House, the hub for the South African Council of Churches and other community activist organisations had been attacked already.

Brother Jude, former Marist Provincial, who resided with the Brothers at Observatory but spent much time at Khanya House in his position of Secretary General for SACBC had been actively working towards the desegregation of schools in talks with the then government as Director of the Catholic Institute of Education. The fear of the power of educational and spiritual related missions against the ideals of apartheid regime was palpable. The statue of Jesus with Sacred Heart remains a reminder of the transformative potential of that power.
