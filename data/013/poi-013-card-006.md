> “What has occurred at Khanya House is a tragedy, not only for the Bishops’ Conference but for the country as well. THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR POLITICAL POINT SCORING. It is a time for all South Africans to realise that violence will not solve the problems of the country.”

It was, in part, the SACBC’s anti-apartheid vision that had inspired the Marists to open Sacred Heart to all races.  Brother Jude relates that further unexploded triggers (including limpet mines) were found in Khanya House. Similar attacks, on Cosatu House (trade union headquarters), and Khotso House (home to the South African Council of Churches and other community organisations), had occurred earlier that year. The apartheid state’s fear of the power of educational and spiritual missions was palpable. The statue of Jesus with Sacred Heart remains a reminder of the transformative potential of that power.
