For Christians, particularly Catholics, the Sacred Heart of Jesus is an important symbol representing a physical manifestation of God’s divine love for all humanity. Particularly relevant to a Marist school, it echoes Champagnat’s vision of providing education for all children born out of equal love for them through the way of Mary, mother of Jesus. The school’s slogan is “Education with heart that knows no bounds”.

This photograph shows how the statue, positioned facing the College entrance steps, looks today. However, the statue previously stood in two other locations at Sacred Heart College. That the statue is now also painted with colours, unlike most other statues around the school, is also significant. The narratives around these changes are recounted in the following slides. This statue of Jesus is an object of much more than symbolising the College name; it is one that physically links Sacred Heart College to its ongoing mission to uphold its community members’ struggle for peace, equality and justice.
