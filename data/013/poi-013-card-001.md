For Christians, in particular Catholics, the Sacred Heart of Jesus is an extremely important symbol that represents a physical manifestation of God’s divine love for all humanity. This image is particularly relevant to the Marists; linking to Champagnat’s vision of providing education for all children born out of equal love for them through the way of Mary, mother of Jesus.

The school’s slogan is “Education with heart that knows no bounds”.

This photograph, taken in 2016, shows how the statue of Jesus positioned facing the college entrance steps looks today. However, this has not always been the case. The statue previously stood in two other locations at Sacred Heart College and was moved for particular reasons to be explained now. The fact that the statue is now also painted with colours, unlike most of the other statues around the school (with the exception of the Madonna and Child), is also significant. An event in the late 1980s occurred which led to the statue’s repainting and repositioning (further information about this is found in following slides). This statue of Jesus is an object of much more than symbolism around the name of the College – it is one that physically links Sacred Heart College to its ongoing mission to uphold its community members’ struggle for peace, truth and justice. Without being aware of the particular narrative of the 1980s, teacher Boitumelo Letho, explained that her pupils (in grade 00) are curious about the statue. Several times, when passing the statue on walks around the school with them she has heard snippets of conversations such as these:

“Wow, look it’s Jesus!” … “No, it’s not real” …. “But it is actually where Jesus is buried” … “it is like a signpost” … “well I think Nelson Mandela is buried here” … “at night maybe they talk to each other” ...

No matter what their age or whether they know of the narratives relating the statue, this is a focal point for the community of Sacred Heart College.
