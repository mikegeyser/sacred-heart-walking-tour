The statue of Jesus with the Sacred Heart was moved to this position by the gates in the late 1970s in preparation for the ‘new’ co-educational Sacred Heart College to open as an amalgamation of the three schools (Marist Observatory, St. Angela’s Convent in Kensington and Holy Family Convent, Yeoville) and symbolically welcomed people to this place of ‘love for all’. Sacred Heart College, the name of the school in which these three groups of learners would converge was already the name of the school but until that point not widely used by the school or wider community, who preferred to use the name Marist Observatory to distinguish it from the other Sacred Heart College in Koch street (then preparatory school for Sacred Heart College from 1926 until 1965), continuing out of habit for more than a decade after Koch street closed.

The last issue of the Maristonian, published in1 979 (replaced by the Sacred Heart College yearbook) paid tribute to the Marist Brothers, the Ursuline Sisters and the Holy Family sisters, now united in Sacred Heart College, under a picture of this statue already situated in its new location just inside the school gates.

The statue was only to remain in this spot for about seven years. Events in 1987 necessitated restoration of the statue and resulted in the statue being moved to its current location today.
