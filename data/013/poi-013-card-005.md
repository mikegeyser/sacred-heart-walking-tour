This ‘warning’ to black students not to attend school in June 1987 was likely printed and distributed by the security forces, and dropped at Sacred Heart by one Sergeant Beyers. The intention was no doubt to give the impression that black students were behind the necklacing of the Sacred Heart statue and to create discord within the school and Marist community, well known for its inclusivity and racial integration. In some ironic-comic performance, Sergeant Beyers was dispatched to school the next morning when Brother Neil called the authorities to explain what had occurred during the night. 

To prevent the charred statue scaring the students (of all races) coming into school, Brother Neil and two colleagues moved the statue whilst his sister Geraldine restored and painted it. The statue was re-erected opposite the main steps in an act of defiance towards those responsible for the necklacing; rather than discarding the burnt statue it was brought physically closer to the school’s heart, demonstrating that ‘love for all’ was the true nature of the College.
