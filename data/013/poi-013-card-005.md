Printed as if a warning to black students not to attend school in June 1897 in solidarity with the events of June 1976 and the student uprising that began the unsettling of the apartheid regime, this leaflet was more likely created to give the impression that black students were behind the necklacing of the Sacred Heart Statue and intended to create discord within the community (both school and Marist) that was known already for its inclusivity and racially mixed make-up and was printed by those connected with and aligned to the governing political body.

As Brother Neil’s account explains (this can be heard in the previous slide) it was more likely printed and distributed by the (rogue) security forces and personally dropped by one Sergeant Beyers, who as if in some ironic-comic performance, was dispatched to the school the next morning when Brother Neil called the authorities to explain what had occurred at the school during the night.

The statue of Jesus was removed by Brother Neil and two other colleagues that day for fear of the effects of seeing the post-necklaced might have on the students (both white and black) coming into school. Brother Neil’s sister Geraldine (also responsible for the grotto statue) repainted the statue of Jesus and added the colour to it at that time.

The re-erection of the statue opposite the main steps was to signify defiance towards those responsible for the necklacing at the time – rather than discarding the burnt statue, it had been brought literally closer to the heart of the school demonstrating that ‘love for all’ was the true nature of Sacred Heart College.
