Printed as if a warning to black students not to attend school in June 1897 this leaflet was likely created to give the impression that black students were behind the necklacing of the Sacred Heart Statue and intended to create discord within the community (both school and Marist) known for its inclusivity and racially mixed make-up. As Brother Neil’s account explains (heard in the previous slide) it was more likely printed and distributed by the (rogue) security forces and personally dropped by one Sergeant Beyers, who as if in some ironic-comic performance, was dispatched to the school the next morning when Brother Neil called the authorities to explain what had occurred at the school during the night. 

The statue of Jesus was removed by Brother Neil and two colleagues that day in order to prevent the post-necklaced scaring the students (both white and black) coming into school. Brother Neil’s sister Geraldine restored the statue and painted it. The re-erection of the statue opposite the main steps was an act of defiance towards those responsible for the necklacing at the time – rather than discarding the burnt statue it was brought physically closer to the heart of the school demonstrating that ‘love for all’ was the true nature of the College.
