 > “Only a few days back a beautiful statue of the Sacred-Heart was erected over the entrance of the College. This emblem of the love of God for men is a most befitting image to dominate an institution placed under the patronage and the protection of the Son of God. From its niche it stretches forth its arms in welcome to all those who enter the College.”         (The 1932 Principal’s Report)

There is speculation over why the niche was empty for the first few years of the College’s life. Perhaps it was originally intended to contain a statue of Marcellin Champagnat since in the early days the College was, briefly, called St Benedict’s in his honour. By the early thirties, though colloquially referred to as Marist 'Obs', the school’s name was officially Sacred Heart College; the installation of this statue in this niche was a physical cementing of this fact. Today, in the niche, sits a copy of the statue of Our Lady of Good Hope. The original statue is kept in the Brothers' residence.
