The statue was installed in the empty niche in 1932. The statue of Jesus and Sacred Heart was originally plain white (as the statues in the intermediate quad and in the Memorial Chapel plaza are today). 

 > “Only a few days back a beautiful statue of the Sacred-Heart was erected over the entrance of the College. This emblem of the love of God for men is a most befitting image to dominate an institution placed under the patronage and the protection of the Son of God. From its niche it stretches forth its arms in welcome to all those who enter the College.” (The 1932 Principal’s Report)

There is speculation over why the niche was empty for the first few years of the college’s life at Observatory. Perhaps it was originally intended to contain a statue of Marcellin Champagnat since in the early days the College was, briefly, called St Benedict’s in his honour. By the early thirties, though colloquially referred to as Marist Observatory, the school name was officially Sacred Heart College so the installation of this statue in this niche was part of the physical cementing of this fact. Today, in the niche, sits a copy of the statue of Our Lady of Good Hope. The original Our Lady of Good Hope statue came from Marist College, Uitenhage and is kept in the Brother’s residence.
