Brother Neil McGurk, Principal of the College for 20 years, was responsible for the transformative processes that Sacred Heart College underwent in the 1970s and ‘80s (first with the admittance of black learners in 1976 and then in 1980 with co-education). The College had started to admit Chinese learners from the 1930s and Brother Vincent recalls stories of these boys having to hide in cupboards from visiting government school inspectors, such was the nature of the school even prior to the 1970s.
