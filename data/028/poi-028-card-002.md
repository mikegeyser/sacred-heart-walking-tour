This article from the Rand Daily Mail gives some of the student perspectives on the merging of the three schools. Learners from both the Ursuline and Holy Family Convents, as well as many Sisters and their lay staff, came to Sacred Heart. 

Brother Neil McGurk explained that the decision to become co-educational was not only a practical solution for the female pupils when the two Convent schools decided to close. It brought together the already intertwined educational heritages of the three congregations, but it also hinged around something deeper:

> “For many of us the cultural context of the emerging South Africa required transforming the male hubris of the all-boys school, which had dominated much of the sporting and cultural activities of Sacred Heart College in the past. However, it was not a popular decision at the time with those traditionalists who had epitomised a good education for boys with such a hubris, which seemed to be required for success in the corridors of power in society. The girls did not disappoint. They brought a new human quality to the College’s social, cultural and spiritual life, and quickly rising to leadership roles, they assisted in re-defining the nature of those roles.”
