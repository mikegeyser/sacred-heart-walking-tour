In 1980, the school which had been known colloquially as Marist Brothers’ Observatory, reverted to its religious name ‘Sacred Heart College’ (assigned to the school by the late 1920s but very seldom used) when three Catholic educational foundations came together into one school.

The symbolism present in the three school’s individual crests was incorporated into a new school badge and crest for Sacred Heart College. The stars from the Ursuline’s, the trefoil from the Holy Family and the Marist colours were combined into one badge. A more detailed account of the amalgamation of the three school crests can be read about in the slides that relate to the school's uniform.
