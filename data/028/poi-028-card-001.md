In 1980, when three Catholic educational foundations came together into one school, the school known colloquially as Marist Brothers’ Observatory reverted to its religious name, ‘Sacred Heart College’, which dated back to the late 1920s, but was rarely used.

The symbolism present in the three schools’ individual crests was incorporated into a new school badge and crest for Sacred Heart College. The stars from the Ursulines, the trefoil from the Holy Family and the Marist colours were combined into one badge. A more detailed account of the amalgamation of the three school crests can be read about in the slides that relate to the school’s uniform.
