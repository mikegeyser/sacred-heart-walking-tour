The story behind the amalgamation of the three school crests from Marist Brothers’ College, Observatory, Holy Family Convent, Yeoville and St. Angela’s Ursuline Convent, Kensington into one school blazer badge for Sacred Heart in 1980 can be read at POI 26 Uniform (slides 5, 6 and 7).

This article from the Rand Daily Mail gives some of the student perspectives on the merging of the three schools. Not only did learners arrive from the girls’ schools but many of the Sisters and their lay-staff came too Sacred Heart at that time as well.

Brother Neil McGurk explained that the decision to become co-educational was not only a practical solution for the female pupils when the two Convent schools decided to close and one that saw the already intertwined educational heritages of the three congregations become physically linked but, rather hinged around something deeper:

> “For many of us the cultural context of the emerging South Africa required transforming the male hubris of the all-boys school, which had dominated much of the sporting and cultural activities of Sacred Heart College in the past. However, it was not a popular decision at the time with those traditionalists who had epitomised a good education for boys with such a hubris, which seemed to be required for success in the corridors of power in society. The girls did not disappoint. They brought a new human quality to the College’s social, cultural and spiritual life, and quickly rising to leadership roles, they assisted in re-defining the nature of those roles.”
