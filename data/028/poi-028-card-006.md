“If mothers in the world had a thousand children, they would find a place for each one in their hearts” wrote Sister Stella in the 1980 Sacred Heart College yearbook, echoing the words of St Angela, the foundress of the Ursuline Order. The message is similarly understood to that of Marcellin Champagnat’s “to teach children well you must first love them and love them equally” and demonstrates the filial bond between the Catholic Orders that came together in the extended family of Sacred Heart College.

This statue of St Angela with a girl represents how the foundress of the Ursuline Sisters’ mission began when she gathered women to dedicate themselves to the teaching of girls, particularly impoverished girls, at a time when formal education for girls was unheard of.

This statue came from the St. Angela’s Ursuline Convent in Kensington to Sacred Heart in 1980 and was first installed, after being re-painted in white, on one of the traffic islands in front of the College (as can be seen in this picture). At the Ursuline Convent the statue was positioned in an alcove above an archway and this niche was, over time, colonized by honeybees. When the Chapel piazza was repaved in 1995, the statue of St Angela was moved to her current position between the Memorial Chapel and the main quad tunnel. It was at this time that the explanatory plaque under the statue was added.
