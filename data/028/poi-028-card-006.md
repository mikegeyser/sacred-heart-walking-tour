Another example of the communal activities between learners of the three schools that later merged can be seen here in the performance of Ursuline girls in the hall at Koch Street in 1950\. Not only were the Catholic congregations coming together but this picture shows three yarmulke wearing boys, representative of the high proportion of Jewish pupils at both Sacred Heart Colleges in Koch Street and at Observatory. At least three of the pictured girls went on to join the sisterhood; Maureen Murray at the front right of the picture became Sister Veronica Murray who taught at the Ursuline School in Kensington and later became Headmistress of Brescia House from 1975-1980\.
