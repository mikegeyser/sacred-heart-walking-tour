The Holy Family of Bordeaux is a Catholic congregation formed by Pierre-Beinvenu de Noailles in 1820. Three young girls came to the newly ordained priest for spiritual direction, inspiring him to establish a sisterhood inspired by imitation of the Holy Family (Mary, Joseph and Jesus) and devotion to the three-in-one Christian concept of the God as a Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). The Sisterhood was to go on to have several branches, each with a special focus such as nursing, teaching and Christian mission.  

Holy Family Sisters were invited to Johannesburg by Fr Monginoux O.M.I. (who also invited the Marist Brothers to the city). They arrived in 1887 and established a convent school at End Street in Doornfontein, at the junction of Fox and Smal Streets. End Street was so named because at that time, in the 1880s, it formed the far eastern boundary of the city; the east ‘end’ of Johannesburg, with Fordsburg being the furthest settlement to the west. The Doornfontein area was entirely residential at the time. Boys from the Holy Family Convent were some of the first pupils to move over to the newly established boys’ school, Marist Brothers College at Koch Street, in 1889. Perhaps some of the boys in this picture were amongst those to attend Koch Street. 

The Holy Family Sisters, from their beginnings in Johannesburg in the 1880s, flourished and set up several convent schools in the city. By the 1960s they had 100 Sisters, split between convents in Yeoville, Kensington, Victory Park, Parktown and Coronationville, and a further 140 Sisters in the rest of South Africa. The Holy Family Schools in Parktown and Coronationville remain today.
