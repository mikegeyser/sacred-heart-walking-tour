An example of some of the shared activities between the girls’ and boys’ schools for by 1906 the schools were single sex. However, the Holy Family Convent at Yeoville which merged with Marist Brothers’ College took boys until standard 2 only. From standard 3 most of those boys, including Brother Neil (later Principal of Sacred Heart) attended Marist Obs. Brother Neil and Beverly Fulton Blow, ballet teacher at Sacred Heart College from 1980 -2016, were in the same junior primary classes together at Yeoville Convent. Of course they were not even born when this picture was taken but their shared history traces one strand of the interconnections between the three schools that were later to merge.
