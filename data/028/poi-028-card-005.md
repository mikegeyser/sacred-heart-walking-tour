This images shows an example of some of the shared activities between the girls’ and boys’ schools for in 1906 the schools were single sex. This also appears to have been a racially mixed congregation indicating something of the inclusivity of the Marist and Holy Family Congregations in the early 1900s.
 
Holy Family Convent at Yeoville, which merged with Marist Brothers’ College, took boys until standard 2 only. From standard 3 most of those boys, including Brother Neil (later Principal of Sacred Heart), attended Marist Obs. Brother Neil and Beverly Fulton Blow, ballet teacher at Sacred Heart College from 1980 -2016, were in the same junior primary classes together at Yeoville Convent. Many of the staff and learners can trace some family connections to one of the three schools that merged in 1980.
