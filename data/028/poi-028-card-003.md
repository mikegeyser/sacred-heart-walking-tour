Founded by St Angela de Merici in the 1500s, The Ursuline Order of Sisters began as a group of women called to teach girls. This was long before formal education of girls was accepted as the norm. At first, the women lived with their own families but, as their mission became more focused on structured education and the provision of schools, it was decided that they would live together in religious communities where teaching could be done alongside communal prayer. Angela Merici chose St Ursula as the patron saint for the order as she prayed before an image of St Ursula in the church of San Francesco, Brescia (Italy). The first community was established at Brescia. Angela was deeply influenced by the legends surrounding Princess Ursula, a young woman whose faith in God was stronger than death, and who was martyred in the 3rd century along with a group of pious women. 

A group of Dutch and British Ursuline Sisters arrived in South Africa in 1895 and settled in Barberton. By 1889 this town had collapsed as a mining centre. The Ursuline Sisters came to Johannesburg and took over a school in Braamfontein first established by the Holy Family Sisters; an early joint mission between congregations that were to reunite within Sacred Heart College one hundred years later. The Braamfontein school closed in 1907 and the Sisters transferred to Krugersdorp (later moving to Roodepoort and selling their site to the La Salle Brothers). Not long after their school was established in Krugersdorp they turned their farm land in Bezuidenhout Valley into the Convent School of St. Angela’s, which existed from 1914 until its merger with Sacred Heart in 1980. Another Ursuline school, Brescia House, was established in Bryanston in the 1960s, and still exists today.
