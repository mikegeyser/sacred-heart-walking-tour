Many members of the first democratically elected government in South Africa chose to send their children to Sacred Heart College. Brother Neil and several of the College staff had flown to Tanzania to help assess and plan for the return of the exilesâ€™ children to South Africa and settlement in South African schools. Many of them joined Sacred Heart College. In the subsequent years the College was the choice of school for the children and grandchildren of the returning exiles. These included the Mandela, Ramaphosa, Ramogopa, Manganyi, Slovo, Letsebe, Motshega, Sisulu, Maharaj and Manthata families but there were many others.
