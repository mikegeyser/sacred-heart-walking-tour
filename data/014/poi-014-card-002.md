Artist Willem Boshoff on Mandela:
> “For some years now my children attended the same school as Mr. Mandela's grandchildren, Sacred Heart College in Observatory, Johannesburg. We regularly see him at school plays and other functions. He surprised all of us with his lack of bitterness after his four neves* sentences and with his astute and accommodating leadership. However, what impressed me most about him is that, in spite of staggering commitments of national and international dimension, in spite of (perhaps it is because of) the many years of life missed while we [sic.] was in jail, he affords his (rather naughty) grandchildren the time and respect one might prudently bestow upon royalty, presidents and the like.”
