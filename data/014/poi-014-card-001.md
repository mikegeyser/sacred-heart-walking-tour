Almost everyone connected to Sacred Heart College during the 1990s/2000s has their own recollections of Nelson Mandela’s frequent visits to the College. To include all the stories would be impossible; the following slides give some insight into the special relationship that Nelson Mandela and his family have had with Sacred Heart College over the years.

Some of the former President’s visits were made in an official capacity (for example when he took the lead in fundraising events for bursary schemes, new buildings or renovations), others more personal (parent’s evenings and watching his grandchildren in school productions). Some visits were impromptu, such as his attendance at the 16th June Family Fun Day (2001), much to the consternation of his security team. Even the scheduled events caused a stir for his team; Frank Hollingworth recalled the attendance of Mandela at the Bugsy Malone school production. One scene required cast members to burst into the hall brandishing weapons to the sound of something similar to gun fire. Mandela’s protection team jumped up and prepared to react, much to the amusement of the cast, audience and President who had already assessed that high school students furnished with custard guns were not likely to be a national security threat.
