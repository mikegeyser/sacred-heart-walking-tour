The Three2Six Children’s Refugee Education Project, a Sacred Heart College initiated Marist project, operates at Sacred Heart College, Observatory Girls Primary and, since 2016, at Holy Family Convent in Parktown. Learners and teachers from the refugee communities (mainly in Hillbrow, Berea, Yeoville and the surrounding areas) use the classrooms and facilities in these premises after regular school hours. But, as explained, the communities of learners are intertwined in many more ways than just by using the same spaces. Three2Six is the sixth Marist school in South Africa today. The logo on the learner’s shirt above (red for the Holy Family location, blue for Sacred Heart, but with the same logo, underscored with Holy Family College and Sacred Heart College respectively) incorporates the Marist monogram in the African continent and uses the blue and gold colours of the Marist schools. The gold bands, coming from all over Africa on this logo, represent the paths of the migrating children and families joining in Johannesburg, finding refuge in the Marist community.
