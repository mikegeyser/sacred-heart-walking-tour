As well as supporting the Three2Six Education Project through a number of events, the school community regularly collects for and donates to other causes. Charitable giving is regularly forthcoming, beginning with those in the Pre-Primary who are encouraged to share weekly on Piggy-Money days and through specially organised events such as dressing up days where monetary or other donations are encouraged throughout the whole school that support local and national charities. Recent examples from 2016 include the donation of hundreds of litres of bottled water by pupils in the High School during the droughts and their assistance of the Rotary Club of SA in the Stop Hunger food packing drive. Pupils from the Three2Six, PrePrimary and Primary were also involved in the creation of artwork for the new Nelson Mandela Childrenâ€™s Hospital which demonstrates another way in which the community gives to its wider setting.
