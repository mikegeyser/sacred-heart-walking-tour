The Three2Six Children’s Refugee Education Project (Three2Six) is an educational bridging program for refugee children (ages 6-13) who are unable to access state education in South Africa for a number of reasons. These can be financial, around language, or discrimination due to structural xenophobia and attitudes towards foreigners and loss of previous school records needed for enrolment in state education.
 
Three2Six operates from 3pm to 6pm in classrooms at Sacred Heart College, Observatory (who initiated the project in 2008) and focuses mainly on English, Maths and Life Skills. Reception (Grade R) classes have been held at Observatory Girls Primary since 2010, also funded by the Sacred Heart College Three2Six not-for-profit foundation. About 200 children are taught by teachers from the refugee communities who in turn are supported to convert their teaching experience into local qualifications through UNISA. These teachers are helped by local and international volunteers and by Sacred Heart College learners (and other students) who give of their time after the school day and during holiday periods.

Though education is a main focus of the project, a feeling of inclusion within South African society for its learners and providing a safe space for the Three2Six children to be is integral to the ethos of the project. The Three2Six Children’s Refugee Education Project is the sixth Marist school in South Africa, for inspired by the mission of Marcellin Champagnat, the ethos is built around inclusion of those most children needy in our society and around the premise that to teach children, one must first love them all and equally.
