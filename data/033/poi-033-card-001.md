The Three2Six Education Project for Refugee Children (Three2Six) is an educational bridging programme for refugee children (ages 6-13) who are unable to access state education in South Africa, for a number of reasons. These can be financial, around language, or discrimination due to structural xenophobia and attitudes towards foreigners, or because previous school records needed for enrolment in state education have been lost or destroyed.
 
Three2Six operates from 3pm to 6pm in classrooms at Sacred Heart College, Observatory (where the project originated in 2008) and focuses mainly on English, Maths and Life Skills. Reception (Grade R) classes have been held at Observatory Girls Primary since 2010. About 200 children are taught by teachers from the refugee communities, who in turn are supported to convert their teaching experience into local qualifications through UNISA. These teachers are helped by local and international volunteers and by Sacred Heart College learners (and other students) who give of their time after the school day and during holiday periods.

Though education is the main focus of the project, it also creates a feeling of inclusion within South African society for its learners, and provides a safe space for the Three2Six children. The Three2Six Education Project is, in essence, the sixth Marist school in South Africa, for inspired by the mission of Marcellin Champagnat, the ethos is built around inclusion of those most children needy in our society and around the premise that to teach children, one must first love them all and equally.
