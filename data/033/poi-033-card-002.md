Three2Six is entirely supported by local and foreign donors, who contribute the running costs (about R9 000 per learner per year). The children who arrive in South Africa as refugees, usually with their families, because they are fleeing war, hostile political or economic situations or other life endangering hardships come from all over the African continent, particularly Francophone countries. 

One of the main aims of the project is to place the children, when they are ready, into government schools. The focus of the Three2Six project is therefore on the skills they need to do so. A core focus is reading, writing, comprehension and application of the English language; enabling them to join mainstream education as soon as they are ready to do so. Those who are too far behind when they join (for English is a second, third or even fourth language for most of the children) are given access to a remedial class, which helps them achieve a level of language competency from which they can begin to rejoin their peers.

The lending library, donated by Standard Bank and furnished by the Project’s supporters is therefore a vital part of the strengthening of language skills. In addition, learners are fed daily (you can’t learn when you are hungry), provided with a uniform (in the blue and gold that provides a visible link to the Marist community that Three2Six is part of), and shoes. Stationery and uniform packs are also gifted to the children who leave the project to enter mainstream education.
