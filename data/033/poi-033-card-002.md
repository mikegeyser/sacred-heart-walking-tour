Three2Six is entirely supported by donors (individuals and businesses in South Africa and overseas) who contribute the running costs (about R9 000 per learner per year). The children who have arrived as refugees, usually with their families, in South Africa because they are fleeing war, hostile political or economic situations or other life endangering hardships come from all over the African continent, particularly Francophone countries. 

Because mastering English is imperative in being able to access mainstream education after the Three2Six program the focus of the learners is on gaining this skill. By the time the children have completed their learning program they are competent in reading, writing, comprehension and application of the English language; enabling them to join mainstream education at High School level or earlier if they are ready. For those who are too far behind when they join, for English is a second, third or even fourth language for most of the children, they are given access to a remedial class which helps them achieve a level of language competency from which they can begin to rejoin their peers.

The lending library, donated by Standard Bank and furnished by the Project’s supporters is therefore a vital part of the strengthening of language skills. In addition, learners are fed daily (you can’t learn when you are hungry), provided with a uniform (in the blue and gold provides a visible link to the Marist community to which Three2Six is a fundamental part of) and shoes. Stationary and Uniform packs are also gifted to the children when they move on to begin mainstream education when they finish with the Three2Six program.
