During the school holidays, the Three2Six learners are offered programmes in the arts, sciences, computing, sports and other skills that the daily timetabling focus on numeracy and literacy cannot afford. 

The learner shown holding his artwork (in the image above) participated in the 2015 holiday programme “Journey with an Artist”. This was a four-day creative and critical thinking skills workshop, facilitated by MindBurst Workshop in conjunction with Three2Six and Sacred Heart College, that equipped the children with an understanding of their rights as children in South Africa, whilst providing space for creative expression around their sense of self and aspirations. Here he tells the story behind his art work which he titled “The Hero”.
