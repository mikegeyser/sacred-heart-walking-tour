In addition to the language, literacy and numeracy skills that are taught, the children are also given life skills in the usual school week. During the school holidays, they are offered arts, science, computing, sports and other skills that the daily timetabling focus on numeracy and literacy cannot afford. During the year the Three2Six children are also invited to participate in activities with the children at Sacred Heart College such as special Masses and in sporting events like athletics and soccer.

The holiday program was first started in 2010 when it was feared that during the Soccer World Cup, many of the children might be at an extra risk of child trafficking. The holiday program was such a success that it has been repeated annually ever since, often twice a year. Some of the activities take place on campus at Sacred Heart College, others involve outings to places of interest such as the Zoo, SciBono and The National Children’s Theatre. 

The learner shown holding his artwork participated in the 2015 holiday programme “Journey with an Artist” which was a four-day creative and critical thinking skills workshop, facilitated by MindBurst Workshop in conjunction with Three2Six and Sacred Heart College, that equipped the children with an understanding of their rights as children in South Africa whilst providing space for creative expression around their sense of self and aspirations. Here one boy tells the story behind his art work which he titled “The Hero”.
