This photograph, from the archive of Museum Africa, shows Sacred Heart College pupils handing over gifts that had been collected for a relief-fund in 1932. In 1932 there was world wide economic depression and South Africa was not excepted from suffering the effects of this. It is not certain for which disaster relief fund these gifts were donated though Wolf Hillman and G.M Newton were Rotary Club members at the time and perhaps managers of their relief fund. A connection between the Rotary Club and Sacred Heart College remains to this day in joint efforts for charitable works.

What is clear though is the continuity of the generosity of the Sacred Heart College Community.
