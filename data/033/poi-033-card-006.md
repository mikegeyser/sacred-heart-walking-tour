Three2Six learners from Grades 5 and 6 took part in a Sports Challenge that included coaching in soccer and netball followed by matches one Saturday in June 2016. This event, sponsored by Kaya FM and hosted by Sacred Heart College, was designed to not only provide a focus for sports training that has increasingly become a regular fixture for the Three2Six learners when time at weekends and during holidays allows but to teach the fundamentals of working as a team. That the refugee children were playing against a team from the township of Tembisa was intentional; in order to enhance relations between the refugee communities that the Three2Six children come from and those of South Africans living in Johannesburg and bring contact between communities that have historically undergone xenophobic clashes. Dolphins is the sports emblem for all Sacred Heart College teams, not least the newly established Three2Six sports teams.
