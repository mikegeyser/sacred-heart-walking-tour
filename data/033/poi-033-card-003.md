The benefits of the Three2Six project are not just for those who receive assistance through the program. The extended family of Sacred Heart is greatly enriched in many ways through the presence and purpose of the project; sharing facilities is just one small part of it. True concern for social justice and active participation in society is evidenced in Sacred Heart College Learners and in no small way influenced by the Marist ethos and the inclusion of the Three2Six project in their community.

Several times a year, such as Sacred Heart Day, Heritage Day and some sporting events (such as the Inter Catholic Schools Athletics Event) learners from Three2Six and Sacred Heart College come together to share in activities and learn from each other.

It is not just on the learners that this impact is made. The Sacred Heart College parents began and co-ordinate a food-packing project which contributing monthly food parcels to the families of the children. This was started because in the early days of the project it was noted that some of the children would save their daily provided meal to take home to share with their families.
