The holiday program was first started in 2010 when it was feared that during the Soccer World Cup, many of the children might be at an extra risk of child trafficking. The holiday program was such a success that it has been repeated annually ever since, often twice a year. Some of the activities take place on campus at Sacred Heart College, others involve outings to places of interest such as the Zoo, SciBono and The National Children’s Theatre. 

This video clip features part of one such Three2Six holiday project. In 2014, MindBurst Workshop and Minimax Perfoming Arts helped the Three2Six children to write, compose, choreograph, rehearse and perform their own musical theatre production around themes concerning their community. This musical theatre production was nominated for a BASA award in 2015. These awards recognise excellence and innovation in the field of business support for the arts. The content of the musical itself, which was written, choreographed and performed by the children highlighted the sense of identity of the Three2Six community and their situation within the South African context amidst a time beset with resurgences of xenophobic outbursts in local communities.
