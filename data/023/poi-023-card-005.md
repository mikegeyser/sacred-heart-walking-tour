The Memorial Chapel is not a parish church and as such regular services are not held by the Diocese here. However, during the school week Masses are attended by all High and Primary school pupils and pupils from Pre-Primary to Matric meet here with Fr Dryden the school Chaplain. Special services throughout the year are also held, such as the Matric’s valdedictory. In keeping with the inclusive nature of the school, special Holy Days marked other faiths are also celebrated in the space, such as Diwali. The Chapel is used for special services outside of school days by alumni and the extended Marist congregation for marriages, memorials and sometimes Ordinations. Performances such as the Pre-Primary nativity are held here as are numerous musical recitals. 

Visible in this image is the original 1956 organ fitted with over 300 pipes. Despite several visits from specialists who’ve tried to restore it, it’s no longer in working order. A portrait of Champagnat similar to Ridolfi’s can be seen to the left of the organ. Four of the fourteen carved and painted Stations of the Cross can be seen in this picture, originally these hung in the old Chapel. On Good Friday, as every year since the establishment of the school, the Marist Brothers lead a walk through 14 stations of reflection and prayer through the grounds, culminating in the Orchard.
