The Chapel's full title is **The War Memorial Chapel of the Assumption of Our Lady and Blessed Marcellin Champagnat**. The building serves as a place of reverent remembrance for those (Brothers and alumni) who died in both the First and Second World Wars of the twentieth century. A plaque commemorating the 49 Old Boys killed in WW1 was erected in the Hall. A plaque for the 78 Old Boys killed in WW2 (named in the 1944 Maristonian) was proposed but never constructed. 

The Assumption of Our Lady, celebrated on 15th August, is a feast day marking the ascension of Mary to heaven. The Chapel built only a year after Champagnat’s Beatification is dedicated to the Blessed Marcellin Champagnat, rather than to ‘Saint’ Marcellin as he is now venerated. Borbereki, a world-renowned artist, was commissioned specially to create the marble Champagnat sculpture. It was purchased for £300 (approx. R10 500 today). Other works by Borbereki can be found at the Johannesburg Art Gallery and in Standard Bank’s corporate art collection. The German sandstone Altar contains relics of Champagnat.
