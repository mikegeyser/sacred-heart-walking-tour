Borbereki, who died in 1992, was a world renowned artist commissioned specially to create the Champagnat sculpture. Made from marble it was purchased for £300 (approx. R10 500 today). Other works by Borbereki can be found at the Johannesburg Art Gallery and in Standard Bank’s corporate art collection.

The full name of the chapel is **The War Memorial Chapel of the Assumption of Our Lady and Blessed Marcellin Champagnat**. The building fund was started in the name of the “Marist Brothers’ War Memorial Chapel Appeal” and was intended, as it is today, to serve as a place of reverent remembrance for those (Brothers and alumni) who died in both the First and Second World Wars of the twentieth century. A plaque with the names of 49 Old Boys who gave their lives in the First World War (1914 – 1918) can be seen at the back of the College Hall. A plaque for the 78 Old Boys named (in the 1944 Maristonian) as killed in action during the Second World war was proposed but never constructed.

The Assumption of Our Lady, traditionally celebrated on 15th August, is a feast day commemorating the ascension of Mary to heaven. The chapel is also dedicated to the Blessed Marcellin Champagnat, being built only a year after his Beatification and hence the use of the title “Blessed” rather than “Saint”. The altar, made from sandstone imported from Germany, contains relics of Champagnat.
