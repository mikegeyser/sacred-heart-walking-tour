The Most Reverend Damiano consecrated the new College Chapel on 7th October 1956. An Apostolic Delegate represents the Pope in a country where there are no regular diplomatic relations with the Vatican. A Pontifical High Mass is one celebrated by a Bishop, with additional ceremonies; in this case the consecration of the Chapel. ‘Most Reverend’ denotes that Damiano was Archbishop (of the then Transvaal). 

The Old Chapel was not officially consecrated (meaning to set apart from this world things for association with the sacred) as a place of worship, rather, it was dedicated. The difference between dedication and consecration is to do with permanence and ownership. Sacred Heart College was built with funds from a mortgage for building works, so the Old Chapel technically didn’t belong to the Marists at the time of the school opening; only once the mortgage had been paid off years later. 

All the funds (£20,000 South African pounds, equivalent to about R750,000 today) for the building, decoration and furnishing of the 1956 Chapel were raised by the Ladies’ Committee over ten years through fairs, sales, dances ‘and other ingenious schemes’ (according to the 1956 Maristonian).
