The Apostolic Delegate (a representative of the Pope in a country where there are no regular diplomatic relations with the Vatican), The Most Reverend Damiano, consecrated the new College Chapel on 7th October 1956\. A Pontifical High Mass is one celebrated by a Bishop (Most Reverend as a title denotes an Archbishop as Damiano was at the time of the then Transvaal) with special ceremonies – in this case relating to the consecration of the chapel.

The old Chapel was not officially consecrated (meaning to set apart for association with the sacred rather than with this-world things) as a place of worship, rather dedicated. The difference between blessing/dedication and consecration is to do with permanence and ownership. One can assume this was because Sacred Heart College was built with funds from a mortgage for building works so the old chapel technically didn’t belong (literally) to the Marists at the time of the school opening, only once the mortgage had been paid off years later.

However, the entire funds (£20,000 South African pounds, equivalent to about R750,000 today) for the building, decoration and furnishing of the 1956 chapel were raised by the Ladies Committee over a ten-year period through fairs, sales, dances ‘and other ingenious schemes’ (according to the 1956 Maristonian).
