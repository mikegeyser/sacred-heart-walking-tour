Bishop Hurley, perhaps not as internationally famous those standing next to him, grew up on Robben Island as his father was the lighthouse keeper. Twice President of the South African Catholic Bishops’ Council, he was an outspoken and active opponent of apartheid.
There are twelve stained glass windows in the Chapel. All but one were designed and made by Barry Thompson with most of the stained glass added to the chapel between 2000 and 2004, overseen by the then Primary Principal Mrs Gorst Allman. In 1956 the Chapel windows were made of plain glass; the circular windows set high above in the chancel area remain like this today.

The windows were sponsored by donors for individual reasons.  The Pre-School raised the funds for the window dedicated to St Francis of Assisi and some of the windows were sponsored by families wishing to mark the First Holy Communions of their children. Other windows were installed in remembrance of school staff members. The ‘Safe in the arms of Jesus’ window is dedicated to much loved primary teacher Penny Frangiskakis who died from cancer in 2002. The ‘let the children come around me’ window honours Mary Newman, former Primary School secretary.
