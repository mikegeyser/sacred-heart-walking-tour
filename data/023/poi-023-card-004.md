Archbishop Hurley grew up on Robben Island, as his father was the lighthouse keeper. Twice President of the South African Catholic Bishops’ Council, he was an outspoken and active opponent of apartheid.

There are twelve stained glass windows in the Chapel. All but one were designed and made by Barry Thompson. Most were added to the Chapel between 2000 and 2004, overseen by the then Primary Principal, Mrs Gorst-Allman. In 1956 the Chapel windows were made of plain glass; the circular windows set high above in the Chancel area remain like this today. The windows were sponsored by individual donors. The Pre-School raised the funds for the window dedicated to St Francis of Assisi. Others were sponsored by families wishing to mark the First Holy Communions of their children. The ‘Safe in the arms of Jesus’ window is dedicated to beloved teacher Penny Frangiskakis, who died in 2002. The ‘Let the children come around Me’ window honours Mary Newman, former Primary School secretary.
