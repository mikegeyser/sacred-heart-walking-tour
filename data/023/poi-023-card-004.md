  text: "This window features representations of Nelson Mandela, Bishop Hurley and Mahatma Ghandi, three figures embodying the virtues of peace and justice. Bishop Hurley, perhaps not as internationally famous those standing next to him, grew up on Robben Island as his father was the lighthouse keeper. Twice President of the South African Catholic Bishops Council he was an outspoken and active opponent of apartheid. This window is dedicated to the Marist Brothers. "

There are twelve stained glass windows in the chapel. All but one were designed and made by Barry Thompson with most of the windows being added to the chapel between 2000 and 2004, a project overseen by the then Primary Principal Mrs Gorst Allman. In 1956 the windows of the chapel were made of plain glass exactly as the circular windows set high above in the chancel area are still today.

The windows were sponsored by donors for individual reasons. For example, the Pre-School raised the funds for the window dedicated to St Francis of Assisi and some of the windows were sponsored by families wishing to mark the First Holy Communions of their children. Other windows were installed in remembrance of school staff members such as the ‘Safe in the arms of Jesus’ window dedicated to much loved primary teacher Penny Frangiskakis who died from cancer in 2002\.
