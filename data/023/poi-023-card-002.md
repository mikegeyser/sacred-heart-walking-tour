Prior to the opening of the Memorial Chapel the foundation stone was laid and blessed by The Very Reverend Hugh Boyle, Bishop of Johannesburg, in June 1956; fittingly on Champagnat Day. This is commemorated with an engraved stone that can be seen on the outside of the Chapel (front left of the main doors). The Chapel architect was J. W. Van Gemert and the builder J. Brouwers. In accordance with consecration ceremonies, they, along with the extended Marist community seen in this photograph, would have been present in October 1956.  

In this image the original parquet flooring is visible. Over time this was replaced with tiling because of water damage through a ceiling leak. The ceiling was restored and is today exactly as it looked in 1956. Also visible is a stone Altar rail used to demarcate the more holy area of the Chapel (since removed). The Crucifix above the Altar and the same 36 mahogany pews are still in use today; these cost £100 and £1260 respectively at the time. The statues to the left and right of the Chancel area, of Mary and Joseph, came from the Old Chapel.
