The Red Cross, established in 1863, is an international organisation that has its headquarters in Geneva. Hence the label given to this photograph. That the school/hospital was under the French arm of the Red Cross is demonstrated by the Tricolour Flag hung on the wall with a picture of the then French President Émile Loubet and the monogram RF (République Française) displayed beneath.
