Marist Brothers College, Koch Street served as a hospital during the South African War. Despite the war going on the school remained open, though its pupil numbers were fairly diminished and classrooms were split between school rooms and hospital wards. The hospital, run by the French Red Cross and serviced by Marist Brothers and Sisters from Holy Family (their Convent was at End Street at the time) treated wounded from both sides of the conflict, both Boer and British. The hospital was given protection under the French Tricolore flag and it was at this time that the name Sacred Heart (Sacré Coeur) was appropriated by the school. The emblem of the Sacré Coeur was floated above the school as a flag to denote its neutrality in the war.
