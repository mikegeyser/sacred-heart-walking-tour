There were ten beds available for sick boarders in the Sanatorium who needed to be separated from the rest of the boys in case they spread infectious diseases or simply needed rest away from the noise of the dormitories. Matron had her own rooms nearby too; in addition to the Sanatorium and Infirmary she had her own private suite allowing her to stay over if boarders required night time nursing.
