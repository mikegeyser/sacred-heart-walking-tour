There were ten beds available in the Sanatorium for sick boarders who needed to be separated from the rest of the boys in case they spread infectious diseases, or simply needed rest away from the noise of the dormitories. Matron had her own rooms nearby too; in addition to the Sanatorium and Infirmary she had her own private suite, allowing her to stay over if boarders required night time nursing. 

Today the school nurse’s rooms are located on the lower ground floor under the Primary School reception office. The former Sanatorium and senior dormitories were readapted for classroom and office use.
