The Infirmary (a consulting room with dispensary) and Sanatorium were situated in the upstairs of the block added in 1932 to the school and is now part of the Marist Provincial offices. Though these rooms were on the same floor as the senior boarders there was no direct access between the two areas and access was gained by a staircase from the ground floor.

The school Matron was a nurse-cum-mother figure for the boys who boarded at Sacred Heart. Though she tended to those who were unwell at any time during the school term her busiest time of the week was on Saturdays during the rugby season. Several matches a day were played and she was on duty throughout to assist any injured boys (including those from visiting schools).
