Matron Blow’s daughter-in-law Beverly Fulton Blow, ballet teacher (until 2016) at Sacred Heart College for 36 years and prior to that for nearly a decade at Yeoville ‘s Holy Family Convent, remembers coming to fetch her mother-in-law most Saturdays after the sports fixtures had finished. The Blow family would be treated to tea and cake in the Brother’s refectory, now the College coffee shop, before Matron Blow would take some respite from her duties at school. Matron’s time off in the week was on Saturday afternoons until Sunday afternoon when she had to be back in time for the boarders to return to school from their own weekend exeats.

Matron Blow’s great-granddaughter is, in 2017, a matriculant at Sacred Heart College.
