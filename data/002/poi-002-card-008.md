The Mariston, appropriately named with a nod to the former landowners, a 31-storey building opened in 1971\. One part of the school building (seen here) was left standing for some time after the Mariston was constructed, but this has since also been demolished and rebuilt over. The Mariston Building was, and is (for this 31-storey building still exists today), created as a multi-usage building with the majority of the plan being for 550 flats. A swimming pool, restaurant and landscape gardens for residents was planned at the time of construction but it isnâ€™t clear that this was followed through with. Today a hotel occupies the first six floors with student accommodation, short term lets and other premises on the remaining levels.
