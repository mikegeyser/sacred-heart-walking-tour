The Brothers sold the land at Koch Street in the mid 1960s as the ever developing city centre had become an unsuitable area for a school . A site to the south and (at the time) far away from construction in town was bought in Linmeyer. The final assembly at Sacred Heart College on the Koch Street site was held in 1965. 

In 1966 The Star reported that many Old Boys from Koch Street had gone to the site when demolition started to salvage mementos from the buildings, like bricks to set into their homes â€“ such was the sentiment surrounding the school. In 1966 Marian College Linmeyer was opened. The Koch Street foundation stone and the organ from the chapel were incorporated into this new Marist school. Most of the boys from the younger years at Koch Street transferred to Marian College Linmeyer, since Observatory only admitted boys from Standard 3 (grade 5 today) until the late 1970s. Some of the older boys went to the established Marist Colleges in Observatory and Inanda. Since Koch Street had been the preparatory school for Sacred Heart, or Marist Obs as it was known, Sacred Heart Koch Street can be considered as the mother school of Sacred Heart College.
