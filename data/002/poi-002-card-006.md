During the Anglo Boer War, the school roll had dropped to 150 and some of the school was turned into a military hospital under the care of the French Red Cross assisted by the Brothers. By 1905 the pupil numbers rose back to over 500 and by 1906 the school was re-extended, this time into a triple-storey building. By 1914 the school roll was over 600 again and plans began to take shape at this time, not to extend the existing school (which was impossible due to the ever increasing density of the Doornfontein neighbourhood) but to look for an additional site further afield. In around 1918 this additional land was found in Observatory and purchased in 1919 by the Marist Provincial (then The Revd. Brother Vital) for development as soon as possible following the settling down of socio-economics following the First World War.

In a letter to his Lordship, Right Rev. Dr William Miller, Vicar Apostolic of the Transvaal written in 1910, Br Frederick defended the particular nature of Sacred Heart School at Koch Street. Accusations had been by the Catholic administration that the school wasn’t ‘Catholic’ enough and they had too many ‘other’ pupils. Brother Frederick assured the Right Rev. Miller that Catechism classes, the rosary and regular masses were held and that provision was made for the Catholic boys of whom there were 135 on the roll. This implies that there were at least 450 children attending the school who were not Catholics (at the time most likely Jewish and Protestant children). A Catholic school inclusive and diverse in make-up; as Sacred Heart College remains today.
