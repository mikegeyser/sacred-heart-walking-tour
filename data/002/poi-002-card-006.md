By the 1960s the land around Sacred Heart College was entirely built up. This a view shows how close the school was the train tracks (that lead to Park Station) and how little room, if at all, there was for expansion. The block on which Sacred Heart College stood is bordered by Koch Street to the north, Claim Street to the east, Hancock Street to the south and Banket Street to the east.

As is visible from this photograph there was no room for expansion of the current school, which since the late 1920s had served as the preparatory school for Sacred Heart College in Observatory and also fed some boys to St. Davidâ€™s College, Inanda once this school had opened in 1940 after the Marist Brothers had purchased land north of Rosebank on which to build a new college. It was clear from the early 1930s that even with two Sacred Heart Colleges, a further Marist school was needed to accommodate the number of applicants wishing to be taught by the Brothers.
