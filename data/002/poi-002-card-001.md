A series of letters between Br Nectaire (in Uitenhage) and two of the O.M.I. priests (Father Monginoux and Father De Lacy), based in Pretoria and Johannesburg, discuss the possibility of bringing the Marist Brothers to the these towns. Marist Superiors in France were worried about ‘faithless, lawless and dirty’ Johannesburg, fearing that the town would ‘vanish in the dust’ like early American pioneer towns. Brother Nectaire convinced his Superiors otherwise and arrangements were made to send Brothers from Europe for schools to be opened in Johannesburg and Pretoria. The letters were written in English (to Father De Lacy) and in French (to Father Monginoux). Some letters discuss the specifics of the Marist mission to Johannesburg and their visions for educational practice. However, Marist missions in Natal and Kimberley ‘appropriated’ the Brothers sent to Pretoria.
