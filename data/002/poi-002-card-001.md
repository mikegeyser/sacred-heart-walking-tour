A series of letters between Br Nectaire (in Uitenhage) and two of the O.M.I priests, then based in Pretoria and Johannesburg (Father Monginoux and Father De Lacy) discuss the possibility of bringing the Marist Brothers to the then Transvaal. Marist Superiors in France were worried about ‘faithless, lawless and dirty’ Johannesburg and feared that the town would ‘vanish in the dust’ like early American pioneer towns. Brother Nectaire convinced his Superiors otherwise and arrangements were made to send Brothers from Europe for schools to be opened in Johannesburg and Pretoria. The letters (to Father De Lacy) were written in English and (to Father Monginoux) in French. Some letters discuss the specifics of the Marist mission to Johannesburg and their visions for educational practice. Marist missions in Natal and Kimberley appropriated the Brothers sent for Pretoria.
