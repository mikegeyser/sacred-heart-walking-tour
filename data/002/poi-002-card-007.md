By the 1960s the land around Sacred Heart College was entirely built up. This view shows how close the school was to the train tracks that led to Park Station and how little room, if at all, there was for expansion. The block on which Sacred Heart College stood is bordered by Koch Street to the north, Claim Street to the east, Hancock Street to the south and Banket Street to the east. 

As is visible from this photograph, there was no room for expansion of the original school, which since the late 1920s had served as the preparatory school for Sacred Heart College in Observatory and later also for St. David’s College, Inanda. St.David’s College opened in 1940 after the Marist Brothers had purchased land north of Rosebank to build a new school. It was clear from the early 1930s that even two Marist schools could not accommodate the number of applicants wishing to be taught by the Brothers.
