The Brothers sold the land at Koch Street in the mid 1960s when it became unsuitable for a school to be set within the high rise buildings of the ever developing city center. A site to the south and (at the time) far outside of construction in town was bought in Linmeyer. The final assembly at Sacred Heart College on the Koch Street Site was held in 1965\.

The Star, in 1966, reported that many Old Boys from Koch Street had gone to the site when demolition started to salvage mementos from the buildings, like bricks to set into their homes such was the sentiment surrounding the school. In 1966 Marian College Linmeyer was opened â€“ the foundation stone laid at Koch Street and the organ from the chapel at Koch Street were incorporated into this new Marist school. Most of the boys from the younger years at Koch Street transferred to Marian College Linmeyer since boys were only admitted from Standard 3 (grade 5 today) at Observatory before the end of the 1970s. Some of the older boys went to the already established Marist Colleges in Observatory and Inanda. Since Koch Street had been the preparatory school for Sacred Heart or Marist Obs as it was known, Sacred Heart Koch street can be considered as the mother school of the school today at Eckstein Street.
