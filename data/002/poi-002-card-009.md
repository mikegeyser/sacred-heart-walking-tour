The Mariston, a 31-storey building appropriately named with a nod to the former landowners, opened in 1971. One part of the school building (seen here) was left standing for some time after the Mariston was constructed, but this has since also been demolished and built over. The Mariston Building, which is still standing today, was created as a multi-usage building with 550 flats. A swimming pool, restaurant and landscaped gardens were planned at the time of construction but it isnâ€™t clear that this was followed through. Today a hotel occupies the first six floors, with student accommodation, short term lets and other premises on the remaining levels.
