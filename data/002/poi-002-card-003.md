> “Here are their names: Brother Frederick, Principal, a good little Bourguignon* who has been in the Colony for 10 years already; Brother Albert-Dominic, a courageous Irishman who has been with me here since last March and Brother Euphrase an excellent Belgian who will teach Dutch. Three excellent pious men who will be an asset to you and edifying for your parish.”

Brother Frederick was Principal for the first thirteen years of the school’s existence until 1903 when he was made Marist Provincial for the newly created administrative Province of South Africa (the first outside of Europe). He was seen as a fatherly figure by his pupils, famed around the school for carrying a small black bag with him (containing sweets and sticks) that he dove into to appropriately reward or rebuke deserving pupils. Brother Frederick lived until three weeks before his 100th birthday in 1946, having survived the cyclone that killed Brother Euphrase in Basutoland in 1912, where they had been posted after Koch Street to another Marist mission. Brother Albert-Dominic died after an illness in 1894.
