By 1890 the school roll had reached 800 and the school building was far too cramped to accommodate even half of the boys; thus a new double-storey school house was constructed. Even so, the most junior pupils still couldnâ€™t be accommodated within the new building and nearly 200 of them were taught in a marquee pitched in the playground, with others timetabled to sports and other subjects taught in areas around the playground. No longer open veld, the walled playground, which doubled as a cadet training ground and cricket field/soccer pitch, also contained a cottage where the Brothers (and their beehives) resided, a gym, a greenhouse, a woodwork room, a chapel and prototype science laboratory (which pupils were charged an extra fee to use). Space at Koch Street was already becoming tight. 

The school was creating quite a reputation for itself in Johannesburg. Gymnastic displays put on by the school became quite a societal fixture, with such big crowds of people turning out to watch that the school yard was not big enough, and the Wanderers grounds were used for displays. The boys were invited to take part in the annual Carnival Procession through the streets of the city and again in special displays (on foot, on bicycles, with gym equipment, in Reed or Brass Bands leading the Cadet Corps) for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897 and the Coronation of King Edward in 1902.
