According to records, 27 pupils (7 Catholics, 12 non-Catholics and 8 Jews) arrived to register on the first day, Wednesday 9th October 1889\. The the first school pupil to arrive at the new school was Peter Busschau (in 2017 there are still Busschau’s from the same family at Marist schools). Not long after Busschau’s arrival a wagon load of boys came from the End Street Convent, run by the Holy Family sisters, bringing their desks with them. Within the first two years the school roll was at 300 pupils. In these early days the school was known as Marist Brothers’ College.

The single-storey building in the background was the school house – divided inside with wood and glass panels into three classroom areas. This became the ground floor of the western wing of the Koch street premises as it started to grow. The playground at this stage was open veld for Doornfontein was not yet built up.

In this photograph the boy on the tricycle is identified as George Nolan – later to become uncle of Brother Paul, a much beloved member of the Eckstein Street community of Marist Brothers. Another of the boys here, as recorded in the Marist Archives (but not clearly identifiable due to the quality of the image) is Joe Geddes – later to become a teacher at the school and after whom one of the school houses is named.
