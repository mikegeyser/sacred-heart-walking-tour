Johannesburg’s first Catholic Mass was said in Ferreira’s camp in February 1887, ten years after the first Catholics (Oblate priests from the O.M.I. missionary congregation) arrived in the then South African Republic in 1878. It was decided the town needed a school for Catholic children and The Holy Family sent six Sisters to set up a Convent school in October 1887. St Mary’s was Johannesburg’s first school. It was such a success that they decided to start a school for boys. The O.M.I. priests, not teachers themselves, wrote to the Marist Brothers, asking them to extend their missions already established elsewhere in South Africa. 

There were many delays in getting the Brothers to Johannesburg, due to security concerns, finance and demands from other Marist missions in South Africa.  According to Brother Nectaire, the three Brothers had begun to lose hope that they might ever reach their destination.
