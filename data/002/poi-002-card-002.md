Johannesburg’s first Catholic Mass was said in Ferreira’s camp in February 1887, ten years after the first Catholics (Oblate priests from the O.M.I missionary congregation) arrived in the then Transvaal in 1878. It was decided a school for Catholic children was needed and The Holy Family sent six Sisters to set up a Convent school in October 1887, Johannesburg’s first school. It was such a success that expansion was needed, specifically a school for boys. The O.M.I priests, not teachers themselves, wrote to the Marist Brothers asking them to extend their missions already established elsewhere in South Africa to the Transvaal. 

There had been many delays around getting the Brothers to Johannesburg (around security concerns, financing and demands from other Marist missions in South Africa).  According to Brother Nectaire, the three Brothers had begun to lose hope that they might ever reach their destination.
