Made College Principal two years after his arrival in the country from the Chinese mission, Brother Andrew died suddenly in 1964. The Palm trees planted alongside the Cypress here (as well as the traffic islands’ Palms in front of the College) remain his legacy.  

Soon after this photograph was taken a learner, conducting his own (and un-condoned) ‘Science Experiment’ involving an aerosol and matches, accidently set fire to one of the trees not realizing quite how powerfully long-reaching the blast created would be. Colin Northmore, who’d not long become College Principal, suggested restorative justice to the culprit (who had immediately come forward) and a new sapling was bought. Unfortunately, the stump of the burnt tree proved impossible to remove. Shortly after the incident, Mr. Northmore was visited by a group of the learner’s peers in his office. They were so distraught at the loss of the tree, which had burst into flames because of the Cypress’ highly flammable resin, that they suggested further punishment was necessary. The aforementioned learner removed the graffiti that had become an eye-sore in the boys’ bathrooms and latterly developed a keen interest in gardening.
