Mr. Frank Hollingworth has taught Science at Sacred Heart College for nearly 40 years, having arrived at the school (along with his late wife Barbara who taught History) in 1979. He specialises in Physical Sciences and many of his pupils have gone onto illustrious careers in the Sciences, such as Professor Bruce Watson, matric 1984 (Spectral Theory Expert, Wits University), Dr Ridwan Mia, matric 1993 (award winning plastic surgeon) and Dr David Balchin, matric 2005 (Postdoctoral Fellow at Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry). Until the mid 1980s he coached the 1st XV Rugby and 1st XI Cricket teams and today runs the Sacred Heart College Chess team and clubs. 

As well as his professional interest in Science, Mr. Holly is a keen amateur historian and assisted Brother Martin for years compiling the digital section of the Marist Archive. Teddy, Mr. Hollyâ€™s beloved Jack Russell, has accompanied him to College every day since 2008, just as Kelly, his Staffordshire Terrier did for the previous decade.
