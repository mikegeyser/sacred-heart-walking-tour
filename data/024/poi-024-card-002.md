As Our Lady of Perpetual Succour (or ‘help’), Mary is depicted with a star on her veil or forehead, which links to Mary as The Star of the Sea and to whom faithful sailors prayed for safe passage under her protection. In times gone by sailors used the stars as guidance and for the Sodality, formed in the name of Our Lady, this star would have signified Mary’s guidance in their works. Of course, being a Marist Sodality, the relevance of working in the way of and protection by Mary is of great significance.
