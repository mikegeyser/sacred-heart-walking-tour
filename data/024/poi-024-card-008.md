Brother Andrew, made College Principal two years after his arrival in the country from the Chinese mission, died suddenly in 1964. The palm trees planted here alongside the cypress (and those in front of the College) remain his legacy. Soon after this photograph was taken a learner, conducting her own un-condoned ‘Science Experiment’ involving an aerosol and matches, accidently set fire to one of the trees, not realising quite how powerful the blast created would be. Colin Northmore, the relatively new College Principal, suggested restorative justice to the culprit (who'd immediately come forward) and a new sapling was bought. Unfortunately, the stump of the burnt tree proved impossible to remove. Shortly after the incident, Mr. Northmore was visited by a group of the learner’s peers in his office. They were so distraught at the loss of the tree, which had burst into flames because of the cypress’ highly flammable resin, that they suggested further punishment was necessary. The aforementioned learner removed graffiti that had become an eye-sore in some College bathrooms and latterly developed a keen interest in gardening.
