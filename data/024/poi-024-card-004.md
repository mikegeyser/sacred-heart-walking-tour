The first College Science Lab was situated where the Primary School reception and Primary School Principal Mrs Picas’ offices are today. In the 1960s the Science Laboratory moved to the ‘Manual Training Hall’ (later hugely modified to become the Brothers’ Residence), until then used for nationwide compulsory wood/metalwork classes. Brother Raymond, known by the boys as “Cossack” taught Maths, Science and Latin, was for some time College Principal and later Marist Provincial. Brother Raymond, who along with Brothers Neil and Rudolph, championed the building of a new science block died before its completion in 1973. The latter two Brothers secured funding from Anglo-American to build the new block (and furnish with top of the range ‘Leybold’ apparatus).
