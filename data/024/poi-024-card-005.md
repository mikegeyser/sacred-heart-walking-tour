The Science Laboratory, in its current location at Sacred Heart College, was built in an area known as “The Glade” adjacent to the College Hall which was covered in pine trees. One of these trees was planted by Councillor Freeman, Principal Rev. Brother Paul and Old Boys’ Association Chairman, Mr. L. Spitz, in 1937 to mark the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps this is the pine tree that still stands at the southern end of the Science block; a photograph in the 1937 Maristonian suggests this might be the case.
