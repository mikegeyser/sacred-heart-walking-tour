The Science Laboratory, in its current location at Sacred Heart College, was built in an area known as “The Glade” adjacent to the College Hall which was covered in pine trees. One of these trees was planted by Councillor Freeman, Principal Rev. Brother Paul and Old Boys’ Association Chairman, Mr. L. Spitz, in 1937 to mark the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps this is the pine tree that still stands at the southern end of the Science block; a photograph in the 1937 Maristonian suggests this might be the case.

Brothers Rudolph and Neil secured funding from Anglo-American to build the new Science Block (and furnish it with top of the range ‘Leybold’ apparatus from Germany). They both taught Science until 1979 in the new building having layed out its interior structure. In 2012 and again in 2015 further funding was received from the Anglo-American Chairman’s Fund, the Italian Bishops Conference, Brother Neil’s fund and other donors for an upgrade and refurbishment of the Science Block. The upgrade brought Science at the College into the 21st century and was received with delight by teaching staff and learners.
