  text: "1961, Sodality of Our Lady at Marist ‘Obs’ pictured beneath the statue of Our Lady of Observatory. The Sodality was a society for Catholic boys who wished to grow in faith through dedication to Mary, the Mother of Jesus. As well as prayer meetings and fellowship the society was responsible, from the level of the boys (rather than through religious instruction, Catechism and Mass led by the Brothers), for inspiring Catholic spirit in the College and for charitable works contributing to the wider community."

The first Sodality began at Koch Street in the late 1880s and soon to split into a junior and senior section due to its popularity amongst the boys. When the Senior boys moved to Observatory in 1926, their Sodality moved too. The full title of the Sodality was The Sodality of the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady of Perpetual Succour. By the 1960s the group had become known more colloquially as The Sodality of Our Lady. With the advent of co-education, the Sodality was disbanded at the College to allow for the creation of more inclusive charitable and/or faith led societies.
