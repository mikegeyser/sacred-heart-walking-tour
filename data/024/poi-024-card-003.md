  text: "In 1982, the learner-produced College Newspaper ‘SPLAB’ (no longer in existence), captioned an image of this statue with ‘Our Lady of the Science Lab’. It is not clear whether this label was given due to the statue’s proximity to the Science Labs or if prayers for additional protection during Science experiments were necessary."
