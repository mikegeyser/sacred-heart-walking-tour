There was no gym at the Koch Street school to begin but money was raised by the school and by local businessmen to build a gym for use by the boys and (after hours) residents of the area. Sir Lionel Philips, Randlord and husband of the foundress of the Johannesburg Art Gallery was one of the largest donors – giving 100 guineas. Frank Fillis, world renowned circus master, organised a special fund-raising matinee in contribution. 

The 1895 gym was considered a state-of-the-art and luxurious facility. The gymnastic displays were a huge feature on Johannesburg’s early entertainments calendars and the large crowds necessitated the use of the Wanderers and Union Grounds on which to hold all the spectators. The first gymnastics and PT teacher was killed during the South African War and for a time senior boys took over his classes until a replacement, Mr. Barend Vieyra was found. Mr Vieyra was supported by Mr Jack Lelie (a professional sportsman who also taught the girls at Yeoville Convent in the 1920s and 30s).
