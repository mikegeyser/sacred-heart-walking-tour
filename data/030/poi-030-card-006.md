The school hall was not only used for gym and PT, but for formal occasions such as prize-giving, as in the occasion shown here. Only very senior boys and staff were allowed to sit on chairs. At Koch Street a new gym was built in 1935, for by then the original one was 40 years old and no longer big enough and the equipment outdated. At Observatory, the 1926 gym was modified several times. In 1938 a stage was added (hence the table just visible on the floor in this image), in 1945 a lighting rig was added to the ceiling and between the 1950s and 1990s further improvements were made, which included modifications to the stage dressing rooms, sound and lighting facilities.
