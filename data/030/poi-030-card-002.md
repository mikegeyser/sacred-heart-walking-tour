PT is the acronym for physical training, fitness drills using gymnastic techniques.  Today PE, physical education, more holistically incorporates fitness skills and techniques for a variety of different sports. The boys used clubs to develop strength in the arms and tone muscles in the whole body. Shown is the sports uniform worn at Koch Street and Observatory in the early days â€“ long trousers for the seniors, a thick clasped belt and leather ankle shoes.
