PT is the acronym for physical training, or fitness drills using gymnastic techniques. Today PE, physical education, is a more holistic subject, incorporating fitness skills and techniques for a variety of different sports. The boys shown above are using clubs to develop strength in their arms, using a variety of motions, and to tone muscles in the whole body. The boys wear the uniform that was compulsorary for sports at Koch Street and Observatory in the early days â€“ long trousers for the seniors, a thick clasped belt and leather ankle shoes.
