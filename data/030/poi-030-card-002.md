PT was the acronym for physical training. It was essentially fitness training using gymnastic techniques. Today’s PE, physical education, is more holistic a subject as it incorporates skills that can be used in a variety of different sports as well as fitness training. The boys here are using clubs as part of their training. Clubs were particularly used to develop strength in the arms but using them in a variety of motions (as shown in this picture) can tone muscles in the whole body and as such increase overall fitness levels.

The younger Marist boys looking on are wearing school caps with the Marist monogram embroidered on the front. The senior boys performing the PT exercises are wearing the uniform that was compulsorary for sports at both Koch Street and at Observatory in the early days – no shorts but long trousers for the seniors, a thick clasped belt and leather ankle shoes.
