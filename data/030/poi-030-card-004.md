The Hall was built at the same time as the main school building at Observatory and was ready for the opening of the school in 1926\. This photograph was taken in the very early days before the installation of the World War One memorial which was installed by 1930 to the left hand side of the door in the centre of the back wall. Note the gymnastics apparatus that was fixed into the ceiling. The original ceiling, pressed metal panelling painted in white can also be seen. The boys here are wearing shorts with their gymnastic kit which was an addition to the uniform for the junior boys.
