When Sacred Heart College opened in 1889 there was no hall space to use for assemblies or PT (physical training). The school used the open space at the Wanderers Club (not to be confused with the Wanderers Club’s new grounds in Illovo), as it was available for use by the public when not in use by the cricket club. It was west of Joubert Park and a few blocks away from the Koch Street school. Today railway tracks run over the Old Wanderers Club grounds as the property was purchased by the railways to enlarge Park Station in the 1930s. 

Large crowds of people came to watch the displays by the Marist boys at the Wanderers Club – often many hundreds of spectators. The boys developed such a prestigious local reputation for their displays that they became a much anticipated feature of the annual carnival parade in town. During the South African War, when a curfew was placed on residents of Johannesburg, the entry ticket to the Marist gym display was used as a ‘late pass’ and therefore much coveted as no one was allowed out after 9pm without a pass.
