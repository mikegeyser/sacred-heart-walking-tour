There are two private school bus routes that collect learners â€“ one coming from the west of town (Parkview) and one coming from the south (Robertsham). Other students come by taxi, a few on foot, but the vast majority are driven to school by parents, carers and guardians. The same school buses also collect and return the Three2Six learners to their homes in areas such as Berea and Hillbrow in the afternoons.
