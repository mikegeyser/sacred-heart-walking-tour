In a 1965 article in the Rand Daily Mail, the journalist H. Carruthers (an alumnus of Koch Street), captioned this picture “a bunch of students about to ride home at the end of the day” and noted that stabling for horses was one of the perks students could enjoy, advertised by the school as late as 1903\. The 1999 Sacred Heart Yearbook (p66) reprinted this picture with the caption: _Transport to school has changed somewhat. But is it as much fun?_
