The 1935 Maristonian (p55) records that along with the building of the new quad (now the Primary School Foundation Quad) a new bike shed was built, with spaces for 170 bicycles. This would have been at the back of the changing room facilities, where the music rooms now stand. During the late 1930s to 1950s the bicycle would have been the choice of transport for many of the boys. 

There was an active cycling club for boarders, which organised outings most weekends together with the clubs at Koch Street and St David’s. Sometimes they would cycle as far as Little Falls in Roodeport. The first recorded Marist cyclists in Johannesburg took part in a procession for the Coronation of King Edward VII in 1902. More recently, in 2015 and 2016, student and community cyclists have taken part in the ‘Hearts into the Future’ cycle ride around the city organised by Sacred Heart on Heritage Day (in 2015 and 2016) to raise awareness against xenophobia, whilst connecting participants with each other and their local heritage.
