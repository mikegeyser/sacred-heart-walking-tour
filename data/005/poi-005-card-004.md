Between the 1960s and 1980s the 22 bus followed a route from Cyrildene, through Observatory and into town via Yeoville. This provided for a connection between the Sacred Heart nursery school campus, then in Yeoville (at the Holy Family Convent), and the main school at Observatory. Currently the 421 Metro Bus route runs along a similar route. The 22 bus was the choice of transport for many whereas other pupils took trams as far as Yeoville and then walked to Eckstein Street. According to maps and other documents in Museum Africaâ€™s archive, the 1903 a tram route was proposed to run up to and stop in Eckstein street but the line was only constructed as far as Yeoville.
