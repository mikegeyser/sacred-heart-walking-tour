Between the 1960s and 1980s the 22 bus followed a route from Cyrildene, through Observatory and into town via Yeoville. This route connected the Sacred Heart nursery school campus, then in Yeoville (at the Holy Family Convent), and the main school at Observatory. Currently the 421 Metrobus route runs along a similar route. The 22 bus was the choice of transport for many pupils, while others took trams as far as Yeoville and then walked to Eckstein Street. According to maps and other documents in Museum Africaâ€™s archive, a tram route was proposed in 1903 to run up to and stop in Eckstein Street but the line was only constructed as far as Yeoville.
