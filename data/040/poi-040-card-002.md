Until the Brothers’ Residence was constructed in the mid 1980s the Brothers’ resided in rooms upstairs in the main building (today these are the offices and staff room between the top of the foyer staircase and the Old Chapel Theatre). As such they had their own Dining Room in which to eat and retire separately from the Boarders (until the mid 1970s when boarding was phased out) and from the rest of daily school life (until the 1980s).
