Until the Brothers’ Residence was constructed in the mid-1980s, the Brothers resided in rooms upstairs in the main building. Today these are the offices and staff room between the top of the foyer staircase and the Old Chapel Theatre. The Brothers had their own Dining Room so that they could eat separately from the Boarders (until the mid 1970s, when boarding was phased out) and retire together from daily school life. After sports matches on a Saturday the Brothers invited staff (and visiting staff) to have tea in their dining room.
