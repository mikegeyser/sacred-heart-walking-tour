  text: "Tea at The Old Wanderers Grounds (undated). Sports were played there by the Koch Street boys as there were no school playing fields – the dirt and tarmac playground was insufficient space to play matches. This picture shows what would have been either an after-match tea for either athletics, soccer, or cricket (the school sports) or following a display by the Cadets or the Gymnasts."

Lunch hour games and sports were held at the Union Grounds (situated south of the railway track, a few blocks away from the school) with matches and displays being held at the Wanderers Grounds (north of the railway and also a few blocks away from the school). The Old Wanderers Grounds is not to be confused with the Wanderers (new) grounds situated in Illovo – these were purchased by Wanderers Club in the 1930s but the club only moved from the Doorfontein location near Koch Street in the late 1940s when the Old Wanderers grounds were purchased for use by the South African Railways Corporation to extend Park Station’s infrastructure.
