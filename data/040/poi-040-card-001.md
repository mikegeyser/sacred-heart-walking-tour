  text: "Tea at The Old Wanderers Grounds (undated). The Koch Street boys played their sports at these grounds as there were no school playing fields â€“ the dirt and tarmac playground did not provide adequate space for matches. This picture shows what would have been either an after-match tea for either athletics, soccer, or cricket (the school sports) or following a display by the Cadets or the Gymnasts."

Lunch hour games and sports were held at the Union Grounds (situated south of the railway track, a few blocks away from the school) with matches and displays held at the Wanderers Grounds (north of the railway and also a few blocks away from the school). The Old Wanderers Grounds is not to be confused with the new Wanderers grounds in Illovo, purchased in the 1930s but only occupied in the late 1940s when the Doornfontein location near Koch Street was sold to the South African Railways Corporation for the extension of Park Station.
