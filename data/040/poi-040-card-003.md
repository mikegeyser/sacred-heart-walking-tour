  text: "2017, the interior of Habits Coffee Shop. Habits, was so named to reference the former use of the room as the Brother’s Dining Room (a nod to the distinctive clothing worn by the Marist Brothers) and to connect with the current Coffee Shop ‘feeding one’s caffeine habit’."

Religious Orders’ distinctive tunic style clothing, habits or soutanes, are worn as an outward sign of spiritual pledges and of their modest lifestyles. The soutanes worn by the Marist Brothers in South Africa are made of a lightweight white fabric, rather than the traditional heavier black version, after a dispensation from the General House allowing this to be worn in countries with a hot climate. The soutane was worn with a white rabat (a long rectangular collar) but today the Brothers rather wear a clerical shirt with a white banded collar. The rabat is a signifier of a profession; for the Marists this signified their teaching mission. The black cord worn around the Brothers’ waists symbolizes being ‘bound’ to God and demonstrates that the Brother has made his first profession (promise) to join the Marists. A Brother who wears a crucifix pinned to the front of his soutane demonstrates that he has made his final profession to the Order. Today in South Africa the Brothers more often than not wear attire other than the soutane which is kept for formal and religious occasions, perhaps just wearing a crucifix or simple Marist cross over a shirt or jersey. 

The table and chairs in Habits were original to the Brothers’ Dining Room, restored and repainted for use in the Coffee Shop by the Workshop’s Joseph Letebele. The Trophy Cabinet visible in this image was also made by him.
