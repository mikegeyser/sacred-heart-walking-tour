  text: "2017, the interior of Habits Coffee Shop. Habits, was so named to reference the former use of the room as the Brothers' Dining Room (a nod to the distinctive clothing worn by the Marist Brothers) and to connect with the current Coffee Shop ‘feeding one’s caffeine habit’."

Religious Orders’ distinctive tunic style clothing, habits or soutanes, are worn as an outward sign of spiritual pledges and of their modest lifestyles. The soutanes worn by the Marist Brothers in South Africa are made of a lightweight white fabric, rather than the traditional heavier black version, following dispensation from the General House that it be worn in countries with a hot climate. The soutane was worn with a white rabat (a long rectangular collar) but today the Brothers rather wear a clerical shirt and white banded collar. For the Marists, the rabat signifies their teaching mission. The black cord worn around their waists symbolises being ‘bound’ to God, demonstrating that the Brother has made his first profession (promise) with the Marists. A Brother who wears a crucifix pinned to the front of his soutane demonstrates that he has made his final profession to the Order. Today the soutane is largely kept for formal and religious occasions and the Brothers generally just wear a crucifix or simple Marist cross over a shirt or jersey.

The table and chairs are those used by the Brothers in their Dining Room, restored and repainted for use in the Coffee Shop by Joseph Letebele of the Workshop. He also made the Trophy Cabinet visible at the back of this image.
