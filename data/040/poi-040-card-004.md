Memory Mpharu is a mother figure to many a learner, staff member and parent as she welcomes them to the Coffee Shop which is open from 7 until 4 daily. Sweet baked treats are on offer (made by the parent of a former learner) to go with Memory’s selection of hot drinks served with personalised words of wisdom such as ‘be yourself my darling’. Each sale in Habits contributes towards the College’s Field of Flowers Bursary Scheme. Memory co-ordinates a number of other projects such as the sale of second hand text books and assists the PA with organizing their events.
