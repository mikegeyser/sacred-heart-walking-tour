  text: "The interior of Habit’s Coffee Shop. Habits, was so named to evoke the former use of the room as the Brother’s Dining Room (‘Habits’ is a nod to the distinctive clothing worn by the Marist Brothers, a sign of their consecration and modest manner) and to connect with its current Coffee Shop service of feeding one’s caffeine habit. Each sale in Habits contributes towards the College’s Field of Flowers Bursary Scheme. "

The table and chairs are those which were used by the Brothers in their Dining Room. They were restored and repainted for use in the Coffee Shop by Joseph Letebele of the Workshop. The Trophy Cabinet visible at the back of this image was also made by him.
