During the 1930s and 1940s thousands of Catholics from all over the Johannesburg area congregated at Sacred Heart College in Observatory to celebrate the Feast of Corpus Christi. As is traditional, Corpus Christi (a celebration of the bodily presence of Jesus in the Eucharistic service) is celebrated on the second Sunday after Pentecost, approximately six weeks after Easter. The festival was marked with a procession, Mystery Plays and with the celebration of the Eucharist at several points around the College grounds. One altar for this purpose was set up in the arched entrance to the swimming pool â€“ seen in this image with the double columns on either side of the archway. 	

This entrance to the swimming pool is still in existence at Sacred Heart College, though its position has since moved and its structure adapted. The building of the Macartin Centre alongside the swimming pool area meant that the entrance to the pool shifted westwards. The same gate from the 1930s has been incorporated into an adapted gateway to the swimming pool today.  
 
The Macartin Centre and Memorial Chapel were constructed on the very garden area that held thousands of people at the Corpus Christi Festival. When the Memorial Chapel was built, this area became a landscaped lawn shaded by trees serving as a meditational space.  In 1969, the College Library was added. This is the extension that comes off the cloistered walkway to the Chapel and today contains Foundation Phase classrooms.
