The Brother Macartin Indoor Sports & Community Centre was officially opened on 18th July 1992 by The Right Reverend, Reginald Orsmond, Bishop of Johannesburg. The opening of the Macartin Centre marked the end of the 1992 Cultural Festival and the culmination of eight years of fundraising by the Development Fund. Several other school projects (such as the computer rooms and lighting in the Hall) benefited too.

Linda Giuricich, (née Woock) a long serving member of academic and sporting staff at the school (for a period of about 20 years between the early 1970s-90s, teaching PE, standard 3 and for six of those years Principal of the Foundation Phase when it was located at Yeoville Convent) organised the Cultural Festival year after year (the forerunner of the Heritage Day Music festival) and the opening of the Macartin Centre. Linda Giuricich is the granddaughter of Richard Hurly after whose farm Hurlyvale, Edenvale is named.

The Hurly and Giuricich families have a lengthy relationship with Sacred Heart College; generations of both families (boys and girls) attended the family of schools at Koch Street, Observatory and Holy Family Convent from the 1880s until the early 2000s. The six sons of Richard and his brother Henry Hurly attended Sacred Heart College (at both sites) and ten of of their grand children and great- grandchildren followed suite. One of their sons, Richard (junior) was Head Boy and another, Charles, a springbok soccer player.

The Giuricich Brothers prepared for the building of Rosebank Mall in the 1960s and the excavated earth was brought to Observatory to level some of the playing fields at the school. Linda’s grandmother, Myrtle Hurly, was Chair of the Ladies’ Committee responsible for raising the funds to build The Memorial Chapel. Linda recalls family tales around her grandfather Richard Hurly receiving the first Marist Brothers off their Ox Wagon arriving from Kimberley in 1887, as they stopped at the Hurly diary farm before going to be received in town by Fr Monginoux O.M.I. No longer a permanent member of staff, Linda still runs Aerials Rhythmic Gymnastics club which has been operating at the school since 1980\. 2006 Springbok gymnasts, and Sacred Heart alumni, Chantal Moonsammy and Nadia Harris were her students. Three current Sacred Heart learners, who train at Aerials in the Macartin Centre, represent Gauteng with one, Sara Feldman winning South African titles for her age group for four consecutive years.
