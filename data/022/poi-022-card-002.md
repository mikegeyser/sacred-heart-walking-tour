Brother Macartin, for whom the sports centre is named, was as a celebrated teacher and sportsman and later coach (of soccer and cricket) until an accident slightly lamed him, as a result he was nicknamed “Hoppy” by the boys. When too elderly to coach sports but before his retirement to Nazareth House he was to be found polishing and ordering the school sports equipment in “Hoppy’s Hole” (now the alumni office run by Ellen Howell). He was not the only Brother to have been associated with a zeal for sport but his death, in 1990, was timeous with the construction of the new sports and community centre.

Brother Macartin could also be considered as one of the pioneers of Observatory college. On a Sunday stroll from Koch Street in approx. 1918 it was Brother Macartin, with some of his peers, that came across the land at Eckstien Street remarking that it would be suitable as the extension site that the Brothers were looking for in Johannesburg to enlarge their school. Since the sports facilities were inadequate at Koch Street it was the idea of expansive playing fields that particularly caught Br Macartin’s attention.
