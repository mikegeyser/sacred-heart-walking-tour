Brother Macartin, for whom the sports centre is named, was a celebrated teacher and sportsman (soccer and cricket) until an accident slightly lamed him. As a result he was nicknamed “Hoppy” by the boys. When too elderly to coach sports but before his retirement to Nazareth House he was to be found polishing and ordering the school sports equipment in “Hoppy’s Hole” (now the Alumni and Marketing Office). He was not the only Brother with a zeal for sport but his death, in 1990, was timeous with the construction of the new sports and community centre. 

Brother Macartin could also be considered as one of the pioneers of Marist ‘Obs”. In c. 1918 Brother Macartin, taking a Sunday stroll with some of his peers, came across the land at Eckstein Street and remarked it would be a suitable site on which to enlarge their school. Since the sports facilities were inadequate at Koch Street it was the idea of expansive playing fields that particularly caught Br Macartin’s attention.
