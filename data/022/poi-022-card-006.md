This logo which is used by both swimming and basketball teams at Sacred Heart was devised by alumni Paul Swart (matric 1989) during his time at the school. Swart went on to become an architect after his time at Sacred Heart. 1989 was the first year that swimmers from Sacred Heart College swam the Midmar Mile (the world’s largest open water swim that takes place in February each year) coached by Veronica Sandham, then PE teacher and the swimming team wanted something to put on their team t-shirts to mark this event. The dolphin was suggested by Franco Gilardi (alumni and then PE teacher at school) and since the late 1980s has been associated with Sacred Heart’s swimmers and basketball players (since they use the space in which the mural was created). The same logo is to be found on the flooring of Macartin Centre as well as mosaicked onto the bottom of the swimming pool.
