This logo, which is the emblem for sports teams at Sacred Heart College, was devised by alumni Paul Swart (matric 1989) during his time at the school. Swart went on to become an architect after his time at Sacred Heart. 1989 was the first year that swimmers from Sacred Heart College swam the Midmar Mile (the world’s largest open water swim that takes place in February each year) coached by Veronica Sandham, then PE teacher, and the swimming team wanted something to put on their team T-shirts to mark this event. The dolphin was suggested by Franco Gilardi (alumnus and later PE teacher) and since the late 1980s has been particularly associated with Sacred Heart College’s swimmers and basketball players (though the emblem represents all school teams). The same logo is to be found on the flooring of the Macartin Centre as well as mosaicked onto the bottom of the swimming pool.
