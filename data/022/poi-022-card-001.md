Born Christopher Hagan in Ireland in 1889, Br Macartin arrived in South Africa in 1920. He taught at several of the Marist schools in South Africa, including Sacred Heart College at Koch Street, Uitenhage and Pietermaritzburg, and was headmaster of five Marist schools. However, it was at Observatory that he spent most of his teaching career, both in the classroom, on the sports field and with the Cadet Corps. 

Brother Macartin was decorated with several medals, some of which are pictured here. These included one awarded by Queen Elizabeth II for services to education, the King George medal for long and meritorious service as a Cadet Officer, a medal for being the best at Musketry in the British Empire, the African Medal for services on the Home Front during the Second World War and a gold medallion sent by Pope John Paul II when Brother Macartin had served 70 years as a Brother.
