The Macartin Centre is foremost a sports hub but has many other uses in line with its original purposing as a Sports and Community Centre. Three times a year whole school Masses are held in the space as it is the only indoor space large enough to hold the Pre-Primary, Primary, High School and Three2Six School that together make up Sacred Heart College. 

The first term Mass is the Academic Mass, which honours girls and women and acknowledges the role of the Ursuline Sisters in the College’s history. In the second term the Mass is held in memory of St Marcellin Champagnat, and the third term Mass celebrates Sacred Heart Day. A much loved tradition at these Masses is when the school ‘elders’ – the matrics – lead in the Grade 1s, who are just embarking on their school careers. This is a physical reminder of the strength of relations between pupils of all stages and walks of life at Sacred Heart College. On Sacred Heart Day cool drinks and sticky buns are served as a treat to learners, a tradition that goes right back to the Koch Street days.
