The Macartin Centre is foremost a sports hub but has many other uses in line with its original purposing as a Sports and Community Centre. Several times a year whole school Masses are held in the space – for it is the only indoor space large enough to hold the Pre-Primary, Primary, High School and Three2Six schools that make up Sacred Heart College.

Masses such as these are held to celebrate Founder’s Day in memory of Marcellin Champagnat on 6th June as well as academic masses at the start and end of each year. A tradition that has been in place for many years is the walking in of the oldest and youngest main school pupils which is a physical reminder of the strength of relations between pupils of all stages in their careers at Sacred Heart College. On Founder’s Day, cool drinks and sticky buns are served as a treat to learners. This tradition goes right back to the Koch Street days.
