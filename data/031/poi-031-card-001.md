This physical archive is ordered in columned shelving in a small room (c. 4m x 2m), can be visited by appointment with permission of the Marist Brothers. This rich store of information relating to the heritage of the wider Marist community is not practically accessible to larger audience. The collective archive of the Marist Brothers and of the Sacred Heart College community is however more than this particular physical space. Along with the actual items contained in this space, stories relating to the heritage of the Marists and Sacred Heart are held in the fabric of the buildings, the memories of its members and in the narrative threads that link them all together.
