The ‘amazing discoveries’ that Professor Tobias refers to in his letter are likely to have been the Little Foot skeleton (fossil StW 573), parts of which were found in 1980, but it was only in 1994 that Little Foot was declared a hominid, one of the first early ancestors of man to walk upright. In 1997 the missing pieces of the skeleton were found deep inside one of the caves, the Silberberg Grotto.
