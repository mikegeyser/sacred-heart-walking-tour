  text: "The Accounts Ledger from the first school that the Marist Brothers’ established in South Africa, St. Joseph’s Academy in Cape Town in 1867. This was a fee-paying school that was set up concurrently with a free school, St Aloysius’ School (financed by the colonial government) by the Marist Brothers. This model of a free school and fee paying school running concurrently has been replicated time and again by the Marist Brothers and enables their mission as outlined by Champagnat to educate particularly those children at the margins of society. At fee-paying Sacred Heart College this pattern is followed in several ways, through bursaries for some learners attending the College and through the Three2Six Education Project for refugee children."

This page from the Accounts Ledger of St Joseph’s Academy in Cape Town records that amongst other purchases by the Brothers such as library books and ink mats (no doubt for the learners) in 1872, the buying of 20lbs of chocolate, 2 pigs and ½ lb of snuff was recorded. It’s unlikely that these items would feature in the College accounts books today.
