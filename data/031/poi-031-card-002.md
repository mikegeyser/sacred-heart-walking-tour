This fee-paying school was set up in 1867 alongside another Marist School, St Aloysius’ School (financed by the colonial government).At Sacred Heart College the model of a free/fee-paying school running concurrently is seen through the provision of bursaries for some learners and through the Three2Six Education Project for refugee children; it is foundational to the Marist ethos.
