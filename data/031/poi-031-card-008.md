Born Ian Anthony Whiteford, in 1936 (in Johannesburg), Brother Martin was a learner at St Joseph’s College in Rondebosch from 1945-1953 where his family moved after the end of the Second World War. Marist Archivist for over 20 years until shortly before his death in 2013, he meticulously ordered and assembled the Archival material kept in the room at Observatory. In the latter years of this work Brother Martin had begun to digitalize many of the photographs and documentation kept in the archive and, in addition, he amassed biographies for almost every Brother appointed to and in South Africa since 1867. 

Brother Martin taught Religious Education, Geography, the Cadets and some sports at Sacred Heart College from the 1970s until the mid 1980s. He was also responsible for retreats and pastoral care for both learners and staff at each of the schools he was involved with for later he moved to St. Henry’s, Durban and then into the Archivist role.
