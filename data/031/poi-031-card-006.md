During their impromptu meeting Professor Tobias told the Grade 7s about the Marist connection to the caves. He assumed Guglielmo Martinaglia, an Italian immigrant to Johannesburg, he assumed had become associated with the Brothers through his Catholic faith (he is buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery in Burgershoop, Krugersdorp, only a few miles from the Sterkfontein Caves). It is possible that his son had been enrolled at Koch Street, though no record of a boy by that surname exists in the annals. Perhaps the visit reminded Professor Tobias to return the photo of the Brothers visiting the caves, as by then heâ€™d had it by then in his possession for several years!
