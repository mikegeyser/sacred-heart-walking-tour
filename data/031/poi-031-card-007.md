Brother Jordan was born Michael Mengele in Bavaria (Germany) and aged 13 entered the Marist Juniorate at Grugliasco in Italy. As a young boy he would have heard the same bell tolling that is rung by the Grade 1s and Grade 12s to mark their entry into and exit from the College; for the Marist Bell was brought from Italy at the request of Brother Jordan to be installed in the newly built Memorial Chapel in 1956. 

Brother Jordan came to South Africa in 1937, teaching at all but one of the Marist schools and serving as a Provincial Councillor and Superior in his time. During his years as Principal of the College, Brother Jordan researched the history of the Marist Brothers and Holy Family Sisters from their beginnings and later their presence in South Africa (until the 1950s). The former piece of research is kept in the Marist Archive and has been used as background to many a piece in the Maristonian and College yearbooks.
