Before the High School Quad was remodelled in the 1990s the Fountain was more accessible, set at a lower level than it is now. There are still fish in the Fountain pond today, lovingly looked after by Janet Balchin, the ‘tuck shop lady’. At rare moments of quiet, birds still visit to drink. The 1942 Maristonian tells of pigeons and Indian Mynahs that used to bathe in the fountain and were fed by the pupils.

Though dogs are not allowed on the school grounds, there have always been ‘College dogs’. Notably, the late Br Paul’s Alsatian Guide Dogs Sheena and her successor Suzy were a feature of College life for the thirty years that he was a resident Brother. Br Martin’s Fox Terrier Snoopy was regularly found waiting in line for a sausage from the tuck shop at first break. During the 1980s an Alsatian called Freddy used to follow a learner, Martin, each morning as he walked from Yeoville to College. According to teacher Frank Hollingworth, Freddy was welcomed into several of Martin’s classes and was considered an honorary Sacred Heart College member. Today Bella (School Counsellor Marie Grobler’s Cocker Spaniel) and Teddy (Frank Hollingworth’s Jack Russell) are a familiar presence at school.
