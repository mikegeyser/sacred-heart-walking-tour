Before the High School Quad was remodeled in the 1990s the fountain was more accessible, set at a lower level than it is now. There are still fish in the fountain pond today and, when quiet enough in the Quad, birds still visit to drink. The 1942 Maristonian tells of pigeons and Indian Mynahs that used to bathe in the fountain in and that were fed by the pupils.

Though parents and visitors are prohibited from bringing dogs into school today there have always been ‘college dogs’; notably the late Br Paul’s Alsatian Guide Dogs Sheena and her successor Suzy were a feature of college life for the thirty years that he was a resident Brother at Observatory and Brother Martin’s Fox Terrier Snoopy was regularly found waiting in line for a sausage from the Tuckshop at first break. During the 1980s an Alsatian called Freddy used to follow a learner, Martin, each morning as he walked from Yeoville to College. According to teacher Frank Hollingworth, Freddy was welcomed into several of the classes that Martin attended and for about five years was considered an honorary Sacred Heart College member. Today one might catch sight of Bella (Marie Grobler’s - School Counsellor - Cocker Spaniel) and Teddy (Frank Hollingworth’s Jack Russell) in the school grounds.
