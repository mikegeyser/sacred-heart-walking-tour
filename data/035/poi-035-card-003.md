When the Main Quad was constructed it was built perfectly flat but, because of this, the space often became flooded during heavy rains. Hence it was joked that the Quad was modelled on Piazza San Marco in Venice (which sits just above sea level and for centuries has flooded when the tides are high). Of course this wasn’t practical for a College meeting place and thoroughfare and so in 1997 the Quad was renovated. This was mainly financed by the College tuck shop and facilitated by the College Development Fund. The renovations to the Quad also included covering the western walkways, and necessitated a revamp of the College’s Foyer with adaptations to the sweeping staircase area, including Italianate recessed lighting and cornices on the inside and an extension to the balcony overhanging the Quad. That the style was Italian in theme was perhaps a nod to the Venetian in-joke. The two trees that graced the original Quad were replaced with Fever trees in the planters, donated by Moreland Developments with their special irrigation system donated by the 1996 matrics.
