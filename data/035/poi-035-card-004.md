Leavers from the High School and Primary School senior years traditionally club together and leave a lasting addition to the College facilities. Some of these have included trees and planters in the Foundation Quad, benches and tables in the Intermediate Quad and other furnishings around the grounds. The mosaics inset to the circular brick platforms in the Quad and adorning the archway tunnel that leads towards the sports fields were created by High School learners during the 2010 Sacred Arts Festival. 

It was inside this archway, in 1998, that President Mandela contributed his signature to a mural created by the SRC. Unfortunately, a miscommunication led to this being painted over!
