The Main Quad with its fountain was completed when the school in Observatory opened its doors to pupils in 1926. This space, with its central water feature, is one of the oldest spaces in the College. It has always been a place for school morning assemblies though originally the whole school met here to pray and listen to notices (note the younger boys visible at the front of this image). However, there would have been about 500 learners at the college in the mid 1940s, now there more than twice as many -  so morning assemblies are split between the three quads for the different learning phases (Foundation and Intermediate Primary and High School). 

The fountain is just about visible in the midst of the assembled boys. A notable difference is the small balcony that can be seen to the right of the picture; today this balcony has been enlarged and the upstairs room it is accessed off restructured to contain bathrooms for College visitors and staff. Also note how there is no verandah style walkway on the western edge of the Quad at this stage â€“ this was only added in 1997.
