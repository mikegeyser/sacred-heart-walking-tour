The Fountain continues to be a place of fascination and focus for Sacred Heart College community members, from the Pre-School, who come to see the fish and who draw the Fountain in their art sessions (likely not for the last time during their school careers), to past pupils and staff members who find the feature evokes memories of their times at the school. A search of the alumni Facebook page reveals several posts that recall this spot as meaningful and central to their recollections of time spent at the College. When it is extremely cold in the winter, icicles hang over the edges of the stone circles and sometimes even form on the nearby plants set into the concrete circular planters at the four corners of the raised Fountain surround.
