The direction that learners face for assembly is the same today as it has been for years. Though daily assemblies take place in the Quads and this is the point at which attendance and latecomers are noted and these gatherings last for around ten minutes. However, since 1992, a Friday morning timetabled slot was reintroduced (based on a decision to return to the more formal assemblies which were found pictured in the archive dating from the 1920s and 1930s) which gathered sections of the school in the hall for a more instructive and reflective session of assembly.
