The direction that learners face for assembly is the same today as it has been for years. Daily assemblies take place in the Quads and these gatherings last around ten minutes. This is also the point at which attendance and latecomers are noted. However, since 1992 a decision was taken to return to the more formal assemblies which were found pictured in the archive dating from the 1920s and 1930s, which gathered sections of the school in the hall for a more instructive and reflective session. Today the High School has assembly in the Hall on Wednesday mornings, while the Foundation and Intermediate Phases use the Chapel for hymn practice once a week.
