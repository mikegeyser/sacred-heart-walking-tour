Boarders were admitted to Sacred Heart, Observatory from its opening in 1926 until 1973\. Until the second dormitory was added the boarders weren’t all accommodated in the main school, such was the demand for boarding places – some were lodged in houses in the Observatory neighbourhood and others were put up in spare rooms around the College. However, this wasn’t satisfactory so the new wing was added. This new wing contained a further dormitory, a library, Chaplain’s rooms and a Sanatorium. The 1937 Maristonian reads “ample accommodation is provided in the handsome and extensive buildings, which, recently erected, have been designed to ensure the comfort and health of the pupils”. The new dormitory was designed to sleep about 60 boarders but later accounts record that each dormitory slept up to 100 boys at a time.

The Brothers slept in rooms in the main College off the other side of the main staircase from the Junior Dormitory (now the upstairs area in which the staff room and administrative offices that belong to the School Counsellor and Chaplain can be found). According to those who still recall those days it was so cold in winter that boys and Brothers sometimes slept underneath their mattresses! The Senior Boarders were luckier – in the new wing was added electric heating was installed.

The second dormitory in the new wing became the Senior Boarders room. The first dormitory, which was then designated to the Junior Boarders, was in the main building. The first dormitory, once an open-plan large room that was designed to sleep up to 50 boys was later partitioned off to make the the classrooms that now situated above the media centre and coffee shop. The senior dormitory was also partitioned off to make classrooms in the late 1970s to allow for the increase in pupil numbers after the school amalgamated with two Convent schools to become Co-Educational in 1980.
