Boarders were admitted to the College from its opening in 1926 until 1973. Such was the demand for boarding places that some boys were lodged in homes in the Observatory neighbourhood. Others were put up in spare rooms around the College.  However, this wasn’t satisfactory. The new wing that was added doubled boarding capacity and also contained a library, Chaplain’s rooms and the Sanatorium. The 1937 Maristonian reads “ample accommodation is provided in the handsome and extensive buildings, which, recently erected, have been designed to ensure the comfort and health of the pupils”. The Brothers slept in rooms in the main College off the other side of the main staircase from the Junior Dormitory (now the upstairs area where the staff room and administrative offices that belong to the School Counsellor and Chaplain can be found). According to those who still recall those days it was so cold in winter that boys and Brothers sometimes slept underneath their mattresses on top of newspapers! The Senior Boarders were luckier – when the new wing was added, electric heating was installed. 

When the school became co-educational in 1980 the dormitories were partitioned off and converted into additional classrooms to accommodate the increase in pupil numbers.
