  text: "Excerpt from G.Nolan’s recollective document “M.B.C Golden Jubilee at Observatory” written in 1974. This document, which reads like a post-dinner speech, was likely written for the Golden Jubilee Dinner celebrating 50 years of Sacred Heart College, Observatory held in The Ballroom of The Carlton Hotel in September 1974. The Ballroom was specially decorated in Blue & Gold for the occasion. G. Nolan was House Captain of O’Leary House in 1928. "

> “have you ever noticed that the windows, opposite the Standard 8, 9, 10 classrooms on the top floor of the main building, are of the type that only open slightly? These were put in to stop the boarders climbing out at night! Sometimes they would hurt themselves or damage roof tiles while sneaking out to meet their friends and go to a film at the Piccadilly in Yeoville, or the Victory in Orange Grove. The door at the top of the main staircase was also kept permanently locked in a bid to prevent such nocturnal adventures.”
