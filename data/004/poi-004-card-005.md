  text: "Excerpt from G.Nolan’s document “M.B.C Golden Jubilee at Observatory”. This document reads like a post-dinner speech and was likely written for the 1974 Golden Jubilee Dinner. For the occasion, The Carlton Hotel Ballroom was decorated ‘Blue & Gold’. Nolan was O’Leary House Captain in 1928."

> “have you ever noticed that the windows, opposite the Standard 8, 9, 10 classrooms on the top floor of the main building, are of the type that only open slightly? These were put in to stop the boarders climbing out at night! Sometimes they would hurt themselves or damage roof tiles while sneaking out to meet their friends and go to a film at the Piccadilly in Yeoville, or the Victory in Orange Grove. The door at the top of the main staircase was also kept permanently locked in a bid to prevent such nocturnal adventures.”
