There are at least 33 beds visible in this picture – more are perhaps out of shot of the camera. Note that the bed in the top left corner of the photograph has a rail and curtain suspended around it; likely to have belonged to the most senior boy or ‘dormitory captain’ and his privilege of privacy a reward for holding this position. Apart from a crucifix on the mantelpiece and a small picture in the curtained section there is no decoration in the room.
