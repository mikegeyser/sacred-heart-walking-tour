There are at least 33 beds visible in this picture – more are perhaps out of shot of the camera. Note that the bed in the top left corner of the photograph has a rail and curtain suspended around it. It most likely to have belonged to the most senior boy or ‘dormitory captain’ and his privilege of privacy being a reward for holding this position. Apart from a crucifix on the mantelpiece and a small picture in the curtained section there is no decoration in the room.

During the Spanish Influenza epidemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 300,000 South Africans, this dormitory was used as a ward for some of the sick of Johannesburg. They were tended to by the Holy Family Sisters. There were fewer boarders in 1918 due to the reaching effects of the First World War, and those remaining were accommodated locally during this time.
