As Nolan went onto explain, it was … ![](assets/images/points-of-interest/03.49b.jpg) … He continues by describing a terrible bout of food poisoning that one boy endured as a result of eating the tin of sardines mentioned above. However, this (and the threat of rats) did not seem to deter the boarders from midnight feasts as he recounts several of them, as does another alumnus, E. Joffe, who was a boarder during the 1940s. Joffe also recalls thick brown drapes at the end of one of the dormitories behind which rows of pegs were positioned to hang their blazers on. He also recalled these drapes being particularly useful for boys to hide behind when they were trying to escape being caught out of bed or in the dormitory at prohibited times.
