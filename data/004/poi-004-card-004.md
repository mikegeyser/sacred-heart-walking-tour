The image shows the beds with the head of each bed against the window. Once the boarding numbers increased and space was tight, four rows of beds were packed into the room, with the beds placed parallel to the walls. Each boy had a locker (the tall piece of furniture seen in this photograph) where they kept their belongings. These had hinged tops which lifted to reveal a space for toiletries and small items. Underneath was a cupboard with shelving for their clothes. Though these items of furniture were called lockers, none of them ever had locks on for there were frequent inspections to make sure that everything was in order and that nothing illicit was kept in the dormitory â€“ for example, food was banned from the dorms. Every item that the boys had at school was labeled with their names and M.C.O.J (Marist College Observatory Johannesburg) and where washed in the college laundry rooms. When boarding was phased out in the 1970s, the laundry and ironing rooms were converted into the school workshop (located at the side of the Orchard).
