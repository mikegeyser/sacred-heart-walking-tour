Thomas Grimley, Bishop of the Cape of Good Hope (Western Division), asked Pope Pius XI to send teaching Brothers to start a school for Catholic children in his diocese and, in turn, the Pope asked the Superior General of Marist Brothers to help. In April 1867, five Marist Brothers arrived in South Africa (at Simon’s Bay) after 62 days at sea on gunship ‘L’Ephigenie’.  These Brothers (two from France, one each from Belgium, Ireland and England) set up two schools that year in Cape Town. St. Aloysius’ School (financed by the colonial government) opened with ninety-four pupils and St. Joseph’s Academy (fee paying) with nine pupils, the first Marist schools outside of Europe were set up side by side in Hatfield Street. Bishops in other South African dioceses emboldened by the schools' success began to ask for Marist Brothers.
