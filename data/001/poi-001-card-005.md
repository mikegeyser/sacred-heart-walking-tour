A film produced in 2014 charting the early beginnings of the Marist Brotherhood and the development of the five existing Marist schools in South Africa, six including the Three2Six education project. The film explores the unique pedagogy of the Marists and the particular ethos of their schools today. A further Marist school in Johannesburg is planned to open in the near future.
