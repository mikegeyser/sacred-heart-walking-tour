The intertwined AM monogram in the centre of this crest (seen on many of the Marist school blazers, though no longer on Sacred Heartâ€™s) stands for Ad Mariam, a shortened form of Ad Jesum per Mariam (to Jesus through Mary), the Marist motto.  The twelve stars and crown are taken from the symbolism in the book of Revelation (21:1) which Catholics interpret as signifying the coronation of Mary and referencing the twelve tribes of Israel / twelve disciples (themselves representative of all peoples like the international Marist congregation). 

The three violets represent the virtues of humility, simplicity and modesty that Champagnat espoused. Just as the actual violet is tiny in size but has a strong, beautiful and lingering fragrance, these virtues are huge powerhouses for good, despite their outward quietness. Currently there are Marist Brothers and schools in 80 countries worldwide.
