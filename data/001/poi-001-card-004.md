Prior to 1908 the Marists in South Africa were bound by administration in Europe however, from then South Africa functioned as its own administrative province. In 1974, the Province of South Africa was reconfigured to become the Province of Southern Africa and covered 6 countries of Marist presence on the African continent (Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Angola). There are three other Marist Provinces on the African continent and one district; there are 24 Provinces and 5 districts worldwide (the difference depends on the size of the country/number of Brothers).

Br Jude Pieterse, alumni of St Joseph’s Rondebosch in the 1950s, was appointed the first Provincial of Southern Africa in 1974\. Each Provincial serves a three-year term after having been voted for by the Brothers of that Province and appointed by the Superior General in Rome. Br Joseph Walton was Provincial for two terms until 2016 and was an alumni of the now closed Marist school at Walmer, Port Elizabeth and served as Principal of Sacred Heart’s primary school between 1991-2000\. Br Joseph is replaced by Br Norbert Mwila, who started his relationship with the Marist Congregation as a postulant in 1991 (a trainee Marist Brother) in Zambia after leaving high school.

The building infront of which this POI is located is the Marist Provincial office for Southern Africa. Some of the space used by the Marist Provincial offices was at one-time part of the dormitories and the Sanatorium when boarders were still admitted to Sacred Heart, prior to 1974\.
