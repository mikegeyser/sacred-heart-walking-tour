Circled on the map are places of interest that relate to Champagnat, founder of the Marist Brothers. Marcellin Joseph Benedict Champagnat was born on 20th May 1789 in Le Rosey, a hamlet of the village Marlhes. The ninth of ten children, he spent his early years working on his family’s farm after having vowed not to return to school after just one day. Champagnat witnessed cruelty to, and humiliation of, the pupils and this experience, along with the influence of the deep faith of his mother and aunt shaped the way that his life was to develop.

Despite having had no formal schooling, Champagnat willed to study to become a priest and from the age of 15 (after re-sitting the entrance exam) entered a seminary to train for the priesthood. At the age of 26 he was ordained (22nd July 1816). The day after ordination, Champagnat and some other newly ordained priests went to Fourvière, to the shrine of Mary, and pledged their fidelity to her. This communal allegiance took the form of a newly created society (to be made up of priests, sisters and lay people) called The Society of Mary.

At age 27, in 1816, he was appointed curate of the village of La Valla and soon after visited a sick boy, Jean –Baptiste Montagne, in the remote and poor village of Les Palais. The boy died and Marcellin was troubled that he did without having had any education – spiritual or otherwise. Thereon, Champagnat vowed to form a brotherhood of teachers to help children who were on the margins of society. This he founded on 2nd January 1817 in La Valla, as Les Petits Frères de Marie (The Little Brothers of Mary) or Marist Brothers . In 1823 Champagnat was walking in the mountains when he was trapped by heavy falling snow near Graix. He survived and was grateful to Mary, having sought her protection during the incident.

By 1825 the Marist Brotherhood had grown such that new premises was needed and Notre Dame de L’Hermitage was opened near St Chamond. This was designed and built by Champagnat (skilled in metal and wood work trained by his farming father) aided by twenty Brothers and some local artisans.
