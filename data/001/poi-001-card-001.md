Born in **Le Rosey, Marlhes**, the ninth of ten children, Marcellin Champagnat spent his early years working on his family’s farm as he’d vowed not to return to school after his first day. There, Champagnat had witnessed cruelty to, and humiliation of, the pupils. This experience and the deep religious faith of his mother and aunt shaped his life’s path, inspiring his religious vocation and his drive for compassionate education. Despite no formal early schooling, Champagnat willed to study to become a priest and aged 15 entered a seminary (after twice sitting the entrance exams). He was ordained, aged 26, on 22nd July 1816. The next day Champagnat and some other newly ordained priests went to **Fourvière** *, to the shrine of Mary, to pledge their fidelity to her. Together they created a group (to be made up of priests, sisters and lay people) called The Society of Mary with the intention of carrying out their ordained life dedicated to following the example of Mary and to emulate the loving relationship between her and Jesus.
