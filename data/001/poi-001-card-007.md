Prior to 1908, the Marists in South Africa were bound by administration in Europe; thereafter South Africa functioned as its own administrative province. In 1999, the Province of South Africa became the Province of Southern Africa and covered six countries of Marist presence on the African continent (the others being Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Angola). There are three other Marist Provinces in Africa and one district; there are 24 Provinces and five districts worldwide (depending on the country’s size and number of Brothers). Each Provincial serves a three-year term after being voted in by the Province’s Brothers and appointed by the Superior General in Rome. Br Norbert Mwila, current Provincial, started as a postulant (a trainee Marist Brother) in 1991 in Zambia, and made his final vows in 2000. As Provincial, Br Norbert is responsible for overseeing the running of the Southern African Province (including its schools and other missions) supported by a Council of elected Brothers from the six countries of the Province reporting directly to the Marist Superior General in Rome (currently Brother Emili Turú). The head office of the Province of Southern Africa is located on the Sacred Heart College campus.
