Prior to 1908 the Marists in South Africa were bound by administration in Europe however, from then South Africa functioned as its own administrative province. In 1999, the Province of South Africa was reconfigured to become the Province of Southern Africa and covered six countries of Marist presence on the African continent (Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Angola). There are three other Marist Provinces in Africa and one district; there are 24 Provinces and 5 districts worldwide (the difference depends on the size of the country/number of Brothers). Each Provincial serves a three-year term after having been voted for by the Province’s Brothers and appointed by the Superior General in Rome. Br Norbert Mwila, current Provincial, started his relationship with the Marist congregation as a postulant in 1991 (a trainee Marist Brother) in Zambia after leaving high school and made his final vows in 2000.  As Provincial, Brother Norbert is responsible for overseeing the running of the Southern African Province (including its schools and other missions) supported by a Council made up of elected Brothers from the six countries of the Province reporting directly to the Marist Superior General in Rome (currently Brother Emili Turú). The head office of the Province of Southern Africa is located here on the Sacred Heart College campus.
