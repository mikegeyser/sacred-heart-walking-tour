2017 is a significant year for the Marist Brothers. 2017 marks 200 years since the founding of the Marist Brothers by Marcellin Champagnat and the 150th anniversary of the Marists in South Africa. In the lead up to their Bicentenary year, the Marists have spent three years focusing on the preparations. 2014/15 was the Montagne year (so named for the dying youth that inspired Champagnat to activate his calling to educational work). In 2014/15 the focus was on contemplation around the Marist mission of providing education to those, particularly youth, on the margins of society. 2015/16 was designated the Fouvi√®re year, a reference to the location of where Champagnat and other newly ordained colleagues pledged to start the Society of Mary, in front of a statue of Madonna and child. This focus on Mary honours her openness to the acceptance of God in life and her role model as mother and nurturer. 2016/17, the La Valla year (named for the village where Champagnat started his first school and training of teaching Brothers) is dedicated to a focus on spirituality and mindfulness.
