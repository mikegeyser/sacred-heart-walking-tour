A film produced in 2014 charting the early beginnings of the Marist Brotherhood and the development of the five existing Marist schools in South Africa, and the Three2Six Education Project. The film explores the unique pedagogy of the Marists and the particular ethos of their schools today. There are plans to open another Marist school in Johannesburg in the near future.

Though twenty Marist schools and training missions opened in South Africa following 1867, only five remain in 2017. The Marist institute cites contributing factors as including language/religion and the socio-political structure of South Africa, clashes between the influences of Catholic social teachings following Vatican II and the apartheid government (particularly during the years 1940-1990), the effects of the first and second World Wars (many Brothers were conscripted), the sourcing of Brothers elsewhere internationally, and issues of funding.
