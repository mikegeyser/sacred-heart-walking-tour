A film produced in 2014 charting the early beginnings of the Marist Brotherhood and the development of the five existing Marist schools in South Africa, six including the Three2Six education project. The film explores the unique pedagogy of the Marists and the particular ethos of their schools today. A further, seventh, Marist school in Johannesburg is planned to open in the near future.

Though twenty Marist schools and training missions opened in South Africa following the arrival of the first Brothers, only 5 remain in 2017. Reasons surrounding language/religion and the socio-political structure of South Africa, clashes between the influences of Catholic social teachings following Vatican II and the apartheid government (particularly during the years 1940-1990), the effects of the first and second world wars (many Brothers were conscripted) and the sourcing of Brothers elsewhere internationally and issues of funding are cited by the Marist institute as contributing factors.
