Colin invited nuns Jeanne-Marie Chavoin (top right) to begin the Sisters of the Congregation of Mary and Marie Françoise Perroto (bottom right), the Marist Missionary Sisters."

Marcellin Champagnat regarded Jean-Claude Colin as the first Marist as he was the lead founder of the Society of Mary. Though even during Champagnat’s lifetime, the Marist Brothers (and of course today a much wider audience) regard Champagnat as such. With the Marist Brothers, the Fathers and Sisters became the first three parts of the Society of Mary, officially approved by Rome in 1834. In 1836 the Lay Marists were officialised by Rome as the fourth branch of the Society of Mary.

In 1863 the Marist Brothers were given autonomous institutional status as the Fratres Maristae a Scholis (FMS) or Marist Brothers of the Schools. Each section of the society fulfilled a particularly unique purpose. The Marist Fathers focus on missionary work. The Marist Brothers have their particular calling within education, following in the footsteps of the order of Brothers that Marcellin Champagnat started in 1817 at La Valla.
