Aged 27 and Curate of the village of **La Valla,*** Marcellin Champagnat visited a sick boy, Jean-Baptiste Montagne, in the remote village of **Les Palais**. The boy died and Champagnat was troubled that he did so without having had any education, spiritual or otherwise. For Champagnat, this experience was a message from God. Thereon, Champagnat vowed to form a brotherhood of teachers to lovingly educate children at the margins of society. On 2nd January 1817, in **La Valla** Champagnat founded Les Petits Frères de Marie (The Little Brothers of Mary or Marist Brothers). In 1823, trapped by heavy falling snow in the mountains near **Graix**, Champagnat prayed to Mary asking for protection, and to her he attributed his survival. Growing quickly, (from three to nearly 30 Brothers in just over five years) the Marist Brotherhood needed new premises, and **Notre Dame De L'Hermitage** opened near St Chamond in 1825. Champagnat, trained in metal and woodwork by his father while working on the family farm, designed and built L’Hermitage, aided by twenty Brothers and local artisans.
