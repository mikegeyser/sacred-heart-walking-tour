One of the ordinands with whom Champagnat pledged to Mary in 1816 was Fr Jean-Claude Colin. Within the Society of Mary, set up in 1816 at Fouvière Colin had set about forming a group of priests with a missionary purpose, Les Pères Maristes (Marist Fathers). Shortly after the Fouvière pledge, Colin also set about inviting Jeanne-Marie Chavoin (a nun) to begin the Sisters of the Congregation of Mary. These three groups (Marist Fathers, Marist Brothers and Marist Sisters) became the first three of four parts of the Society of Mary. The Society of Mary was officially approved by Rome in 1834 with these three branches and In 1836 the Lay Marists were also officially accepted by Rome as the fourth part of the Society of Mary.

Though sharing the same devotion to Mary as the way to faithful practice, each section of the society fulfilled a particularly unique purpose. For example, the Marist Fathers were to focus on missionary work. The Marist Brothers, had their particular calling within education.

In 1863, over twenty years after Champagnat’s death, the Marist Brothers were given autonomous institutional status as the Fratres Maristae a Scholis (FMS) or Marist Brothers of the Schools meaning the Brothers could concentrate on education rather than teaching in conjunction with ministering.

This badge is the international crest of the Marist Brothers of the Schools. The intertwined AM monogram (seen on many of the Marist school blazers, though no longer on Sacred Heart’s) stands for Ad Mariam, a shortened form of Ad Jesum per Mariam (to Jesus through Mary), the Marist motto. The twelve stars and crown above the monogram are taken from the symbolism in the book of Revelation (21:1) which the Church accounts as the coronation of Mary and a reference to the twelve tribes of Israel / twelve disciples (themselves representative of all peoples and therefore symbolic of the international Marist congregation). The three violets are symbolic also – they represent the virtues of humility, simplicity and modesty that Champagnat espoused – and just as the actual violet is tiny in size but has a strong, beautiful and lingering fragrance; these virtues are a huge powerhouse for good despite their unimposing fronts. Currently there are Marist Brothers and schools in 80 countries worldwide.
