The display cabinet contains a selection of photographs and items that relate to the heritage of Sacred Heart College and the Marist Brothers. 

Through the door and into the Foyer area another art display can be seen, this time from the Grade 6 ‘World Religions through Art’, an exhibition of cross-curricular work between Art and Religious Education classes, produced in 2016.
