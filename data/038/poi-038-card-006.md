The display cabinet contains a selection of photographs and items that relate to the heritage of Sacred Heart College and the Marist Brothers. 

Through the door and into the Foyer area another art display can be seen, this time from the Grade 6 ‘World Religions through Art’, an exhibition of cross-curricular work between Art and Religious Education classes, produced in 2016. Also visible through the door is part of the staircase, recalled by some, as 'The Brothers' Stairs'. Until 1985, the Marist Brothers lived in rooms on the top floor of this building (now converted into offices and the staff room). Unlike other staircase bannisters around school, which have small raised wooden knobs, set a foot apart all the way down their length, these are smooth. The wooden knobs discouraged the bannisters from being used as slides. Absence of the knobs reminds us of how junior boys were not permitted to use these stairs (and perhaps that the Brothers may have enjoyed sliding).
