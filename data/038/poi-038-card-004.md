This printed fabric wall hanging was given to the College by the Chaplain, Father Dryden. 

Hunger cloths, which are produced all over the Christian world, were used first in the Middle Ages as a visual representation of Biblical stories and in so doing to enable an understanding of God before reading was a skill available to all social classes and generations. In many developing countries with a Christian influence, hunger cloths are still created and used for the same purposes, as well as to serve as a reminder of how God relieves the struggles of those in need. 

In the Middle Ages these cloths were used to cover altars during Lent (a period of fasting before the feast of Easter) and so referred to as Hunger Cloths. The one that hangs in the Foyer at Sacred Heart is a copy of one that was created by Ethiopian artist Alemayehu Bizuneleh in 1978, and depicts a series of stories from both the Old and New Testaments. The text is in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia.
