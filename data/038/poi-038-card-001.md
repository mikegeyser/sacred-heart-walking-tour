The Champagnat Cabinet in the foyer contains a number of items such as silver and bronze representations of Champagnat and of his role model, Mary the mother of Jesus. These items relating to the memory of Marcellin Champagnat, the founder of the Marist Brothers in turn remind visitors to the school of the significance and heritage of the school’s patron Saint and founder.

In 1999 all Marist schools received a similar cabinet, each with their own relic. The one at Sacred Heart is believed to be from Champagnat’s finger. The relic is authenticated by a Latin certificate. The wording can be translated as follows:

> We entrust our faith in all those individuals about to inspect these papers and bear witness that we, by virtue of our office, have extracted a particle from the bones of St Marcellin Champagnat from authentic sources and have placed this particle in a round-shaped metal case, protected by unique crystal, bound with a red silk string and signed by our seal in red Spanish wax.
> 
> We grant into their care these papers signed by our hand and protected by our dry seal.
