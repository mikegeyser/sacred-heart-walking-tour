The Foyer is a space for temporary exhibitions, often of art work by Sacred Heart College or Three2Six learners, and informative displays, including alumni news or materials relating to the critical thinking learning programme. Hanging from the ceiling is a banner that reads ‘good nutrition’, one of many information points set up by High School students as part of a Life Orientation project. 

‘Marist Bros. College’ is set into the door’s glass panel in Marist blue and gold. Though the religious name of the school was always Sacred Heart College (which was started as the senior school to the Koch Street Sacred Heart College), it was known colloquially as Marist Brothers’ College, Marist ‘Obs’ (short for Observatory), or simply ‘Obs’ until 1980. When the Main College quadrangle was renovated in the late 1990s, the Foyer entrance to the College was also revamped, funded mainly by the College Tuck shop. The wooden doors were restored to their natural grain and dropped ceilings with cornices and recessed lighting were installed. A light fitting, donated by Alfio Torrisi Architects, added volume to the staircase space. The Fountain was raised during the quad renovations and, at its new height, was now framed in view through the arched doorway of the Foyer.
