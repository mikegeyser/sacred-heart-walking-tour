A number of temporary exhibitions, usually of art work by Sacred Heart College pupils but sometimes other informative displays such as updates on alumni news or materials relating to the critical thinking learning programme. Visible is one such item ‘good nutrition’ which was one of many information points set up around the school.

At the top of the door, Marist Bros. College is set into the glass panel, in the school colours of blue and gold. Though the official name of the school was always Sacred Heart College, and opened as the senior school to the Koch Street Sacred Heart College (the preparatory or primary section) the name that the school was known locally until 1980 was either, Marist Brother’s College, Marist ‘Obs’ (short for Observatory) or simply ‘Obs’.
