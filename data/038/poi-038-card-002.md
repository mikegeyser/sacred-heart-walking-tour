This bell came from the third General House (headquarters) of the Marist Brothers. The first General House (or Generalate) was in France at the Brother’s residence L’Hermitage just outside St-Chamond, established in 1825\. Later it was moved to Lyon. When all religious institutes were expelled from France in 1903, the Brothers established their third General House in Grugliasco, northern Italy. In 1958, the Generalate was moved to Rome. Br Jordan, the Principal of the College in the late fifties and during the building of the Memorial Chapel, requested that the bell at Grugliasco which had called the Brothers to prayer and meals for over fifty years, be given to the College for its new chapel. Thus this bell came to Sacred Heart College in the late 1950s. You can still see where the bell hung in the passage way between the chapel and the Macartin centre; note the iron fixtures high up on the wall in the nook. In recent years, it was taken down and hung in its current position in the reception foyer.

The bell is made of cast iron and was made by the Mazzola Foundry in Valduggia, near Grugliasco. This foundry was run by the Mazzola family since 1475 but closed in 2004\. One side of the bell is embossed with ‘Ave Maria‘ and an image of Mary with the other side featuring the Mazzola logo.
