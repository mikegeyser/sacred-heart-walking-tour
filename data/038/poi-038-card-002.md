This bell, which came from the third General House (headquarters) of the Marist Brothers, called the Brothers to prayer and meals for over fifty years. The first General House (or Generalate) was at the Brother’s French residence, L’Hermitage de Notre Dame, from 1825. Later it moved to Lyon. When all religious institutes were expelled from France in 1903, the Brothers moved their General House to Grugliasco, northern Italy. In 1958, they moved to Rome. Br Jordan, the Principal of the College during the building of the Memorial Chapel, requested that the bell at Grugliasco be given to the College for its new Chapel. The iron fixtures high up on the wall in the nook between the Chapel and the Macartin Centre mark where it first hung. In recent years, the bell was taken down and hung in the Foyer. 

The bell was made of cast iron by the Mazzola Foundry in Valduggia, near Grugliasco. This foundry was run by the Mazzola family since 1475 but closed in 2004. One side of the bell is embossed with ‘Ave Maria’ and an image of Mary. The other side features the Mazzola logo.
