Sacred Heart College started a new tradition in 2015\. At the beginning of each school year, the bell is moved to the front of the Chapel where the Grade 1s of that year ring the bell to mark the start of their school career. The Matrics of that year ring the bell at their Valedictory Mass to mark the end of their time at Sacred Heart.

The rope and metal rod used to ring the bell was crafted by Joseph Letebele, as well as the brackets used to fix the bell in the foyer, and these kept in the workshop until needed each year. One of the reasons it was taken down, apart from it being stuck at the back of the chapel and out of view since the Macartin centre was built, was because it was just too tempting for those walking past not to ring it!
