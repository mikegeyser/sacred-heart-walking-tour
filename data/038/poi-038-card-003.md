Sacred Heart College started a new tradition in 2015\. At the beginning of each school year, the bell is moved to the front of the Chapel where the Grade 1s of that year ring the bell to mark the start of their school career. The Matrics of that year ring the bell at their Valedictory Mass to mark the end of their time at Sacred Heart College.

The rope and metal rod used to ring the bell was crafted by Joseph Letebele, as well as the brackets used to fix the bell in the foyer. These are kept in the workshop and brought out when needed.  One of the reasons it was taken down, apart from it being stuck at the back of the chapel out of view, was because it was just too tempting for those walking past not to ring it!
