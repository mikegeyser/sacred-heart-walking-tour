Amongst items such as silver and bronze representations of Champagnat and of his role model, Mary the mother of Jesus relating to the foundation of the Marist Brothers, is a Holy relic of Saint Marcellin. All Marist schools received a similar cabinet in 1999, each with their own relic. The one at Sacred Heart is believed to be from Champagnatâ€™s finger, authenticated by a Latin certificate translated as follows:

> We entrust our faith in all those individuals about to inspect these papers and bear witness that we, by virtue of our office, have extracted a particle from the bones of St Marcellin Champagnat from authentic sources and have placed this particle in a round-shaped metal case, protected by unique crystal, bound with a red silk string and signed by our seal in red Spanish wax. We grant into their care these papers signed by our hand and protected by our dry seal.
