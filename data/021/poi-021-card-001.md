In the 1929 Maristonian, Gustavus Hartog (Matric of 1894 – the first year of Matriculants from Koch Street – who later became a politician and retired as a South African Senator) wrote about swimming with his peers from Koch Street in places like Sans Souci (now Parkview) and Orange Grove, where one could still find streams with waterfalls, in the late 1880s/early1890s. Perhaps this photograph was taken at one of those sites. It is also possible that this photograph was taken at the natural pool under the waterfall in Roodepoort (now the Walter Sisulu Botanical Gardens) or in what is now known Emmarentia Dam for the boys also took excursions by horse and cart to these locations.
