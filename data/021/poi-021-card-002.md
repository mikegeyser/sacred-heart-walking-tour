The boys from Sacred Heart College, Koch Street, used public swimming baths in Yeoville (built in 1890) at Raleigh street in the summer and may have used the private Summit Club in Hillbrow during the winter.

In 1905 an appeal by the then Headmaster, Brother Callixte, was made to parents to consider donating funds to build a swimming pool at Koch Street. This project was never realized.
