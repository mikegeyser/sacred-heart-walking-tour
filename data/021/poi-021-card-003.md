On 4th October 1930, Sir William Dalrymple, opened the swimming pool. Brother Jordan (Principal in the 1950s) wrote, in a history of the Marists in South Africa up until 1955, of Dalrymple ‘addressing the throng’ at the opening of the school pool. Indeed, quite a crowd is shown in this photograph taken at the opening ceremony. Dalrymple, a Randlord, was likely asked to open the pool whilst acting as Chairman of the Council of the University of the Witwatersrand at the time the pool opened. Dalrymple and his wife, Lady Isobel, were also famed for their hospitality and for having one first privately owned swimming pools at their home in Westcliff. It isn’t recorded in Brother Jordan’s history if there was a further connection around a passion for swimming.

The view, towards the structure at the back of the pool, is towards the eastern perimeter of the school grounds. The small trees are today lofty pines demarcating the edge of Steyn Street.
