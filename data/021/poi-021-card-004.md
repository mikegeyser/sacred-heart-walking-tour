A series of nine postcards – early marketing materials – were produced for Sacred Heart College in the 1940s. This one shows some pool games, likely taking place during a swimming gala. Not all pool activities involve swimming lengths. Joffe, a school boy here in the 1940s, wrote in his memoires about slipping unnoticed over the school walls and climbing into the locked pool area with school friends for illicit midnight swims (Joffe 2013:68). In the 1962 Maristonian a boy recounted the tale of a tail in the pool. Another boy, as a prank, had let loose his pet snake in the pool. Thankfully it was retrieved the same day. In the 1980s synchronized swimming was offered as a school sport and today the swimming team still participate in the Midmar Mile, as they have done since the late 1980s.
