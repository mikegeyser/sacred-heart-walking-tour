Tiered seating was added to accommodate over 1,200 spectators. The gate entrance (obscured by the tree in this image) was kept from the original 1930 structure. An L-shaped design was selected for the ‘new’ pool to incorporate the old imperial measure of 25 yards along one ‘arm’ of the L and a measure of 25 meters along the other ‘arm’. Both arms were 15 yards wide. The metric side runs north-to-south and was included to conform to the requirements of Olympic distances. Just a few years before the refurbishment, in 1956, Tony Briscoe (matric 1955) swam for South Africa at the Olympics in Melbourne.
