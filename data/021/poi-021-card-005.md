In 1961 the pool was extended and its surrounds upgraded. Tiered seating was added to accommodate over 1,200 spectators. The gate entrance was kept from the original 1930 structure. An L-shaped design was selected for the ‘new’ pool to incorporate the old imperial measure of 25 yards along one ‘arm’ of the L and a measure of 25 meters along the other ‘arm’. Both arms were 15 yards wide. The metric side runs north-to-south and was included to conform to the requirements of Olympic distances. Just a few years before the refurbishment, in 1956, Tony Briscoe (matric 1955) swam for South Africa at the Olympics in Melbourne. In 1997, the grandstand seating at the northern and eastern ends of the pool was demolished. Renovations to these areas had become necessary. Funded by the Development Fund and the PTA, shade-cloth for the new seating areas and a judge’s box were added, along with a sound-system. A second phase of renovations to the pool area, two years later, included the conversion of an adjacent garage into the College Fitness Centre and the addition of the studio space above.
