The baby pool was added, shades were erected over the spectator stands and the starting blocks were remodeled. A mosaic was added to the bottom of the pool depicting the logo of the Sacred Heart Dolphins, the school swimming team.

The Inter House Galas (both for High School and Junior) remain one of the most looked forward to annual events for learners â€“ house chants are sung, teams are cheered and costumes are worn. Over time have swimming costumes changed from non-uniform, to red for everyone (not only Valerian House) during the 1980s/1990s and today they are Marist blue and gold topped with house-colour swimming caps. Since the Koch street days, swimming galas were always (as were athletics) accompanied by a fancy dress parade or at the very least outfits themed by house or grade and this dressing up continues, some years more participated in than others, as a tradition today. The same silver plated trophies are awarded today to the winning houses that were used in the 1930s, year by year the winning house names are added to the engraving around the cup. These trophies, are kept with other school awards, in a specially designed cabinet under the watchful eye of Memory who runs the Coffee Shop.
