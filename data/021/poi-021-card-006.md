In 2010 the baby pool was added, shades erected over the spectator stands and the starting blocks remodeled. The pool bottom was mosaicked with the school’s sports emblem, the ‘Dolphins’ of Sacred Heart College.

The Inter House Galas remain one of the most looked forward to annual events– house chants are sung, teams are cheered and costumes worn. Over time swimming costumes changed from non-uniform, to red for everyone (not only Valerian House) during the 1980s/1990s, to today’s Marist blue and gold topped with house-colour swimming caps. Since the Koch street days, swimming galas have always been (as has athletics) accompanied by a fancy-dress parade. This dressing up continues, some years more enthusiastically than others, as a tradition today. The same silver plated trophies awarded today were used in the 1930s. Each year winning house names are engraved around the cup.
