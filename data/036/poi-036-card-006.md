Brother Valerian (1865-1914) arrived in South Africa in 1889 from Ireland and went first to the Marist’s school at Uitenhage in 1890 and then to Koch Street in the same year. The 75th Anniversary issue of the Maristonian notes that “the energy of Brother Valerian underlies every phase of the early history of the school’. The Valerian Prize, awarded for academic excellence to one Junior Matric at Koch Street (the equivalent of grade 10 today). Br Valerian was remembered for not being able to “disassociate purely scholastic work from physical training” and taught the senior classes as well as gym, athletics and the cadets. He once took his class to hear the first phonograph in Johannesburg, at the time a huge novelty and exhibited in the glass roofed Old Arcade, and was responsible for producing the first school magazine in 1908. 

In 1894, only three pupils, all Marist learners, in the then Transvaal were sitting Matric. Br Valerian supervised the boys’ transit and examinations in Bloemfontein. An illuminated manuscript of thanks to Br Valerian from the parents of these boys is kept in the Marist archive. Morris Alexander, one of the first pupils in 1889, and writing in the 1941 Maristonian, credits Br Valerian for his valuable assistance in getting him through his matric in 1900. In this year the exam papers were brought by military escort from Cape Town. The bust from which the image is taken was presented by Old Boys in October 1916 as a token of gratitude, was dedicated to the memory of Br Valerian.
