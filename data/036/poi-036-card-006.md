The 75th Anniversary issue of the Maristonian said that “the energy of Brother Valerian underlies every phase of the early history of the school”. Br Valerian, for whom the red house is named, arrived at Koch Street in 1890. The Valerian Prize, also named for him, is awarded for academic excellence to a Junior Matric (grade 11 today). Br Valerian, who was not being able to “disassociate purely scholastic work from physical training”, taught the senior classes as well as gym, athletics and the Cadets. He once took his class to hear the first phonograph in Johannesburg, at the time a huge novelty, and produced the first Maristonian in 1908. 


In 1894, only three pupils in the then Transvaal Republic, all Marist learners, were sitting Matric. Br Valerian supervised the boys’ examinations in Bloemfontein. An illuminated manuscript of thanks to Br Valerian from their parents is kept in the Marist archive. Morris Alexander, one of the first pupils in 1889, writing in the 1941 Maristonian, credits Br Valerian for his valuable assistance in getting him through his matric in 1900. In that year the exam papers were brought by military escort from Cape Town. This bust was presented by Old Boys in 1916 as a token of gratitude, dedicated to the memory of Br Valerian, who died in 1914.
