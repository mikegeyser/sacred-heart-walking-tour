Brother Valerian (1865-1914) arrived in South Africa in 1889 from Ireland and went first to the Marist’s school at Uitenhage in 1890 and then to Koch Street in the same year. In the 75th Anniversary issue of the Maristonian, Br Jordan wrote that “the energy of Brother Valerian underlies every phase of the early history of the school’. Br Valerian taught the senior Matric class with his “splendid mind” (something that was commemorated in the Valerian Prize, awarded for academic excellence to one Junior Matric at Koch Street – the equivalent of grade 10 today).

Br Valerian, wrote Br Jordan, was remembered for not being able to “disassociate purely scholastic work from physical training” and thus was associated with academic teaching as well as gym, athletics and the cadets. Br Valerian is also remembered by former pupils for his emphasis on cultural education taking his class to hear the first phonograph in Johannesburg, at the time a huge novelty and exhibited in the glass roofed Old Arcade, and he was responsible for producing the first school magazine in 1908\.

Br Valerian was held in high esteem by staff, parents and pupils. In 1894, since only three pupils in the then Transvaal were sitting matric, Br Valerian supervised the boys transit and examinations in Bloemfontein. An illuminated manuscript of thanks to Br Valerian from the parents of these three boys can be found in the Marist archive. Morris Alexander, one of the first pupils in 1889, and writing in the 1941 Maristonian, credits Br Valerian for his valuable assistance in getting him through his matric in 1900\. In this year the exam papers were brought by military escort from Cape Town. The bust from which the image is taken was presented by Old Boys in October 1916 as a token of gratitude, was dedicated to the memory of Br Valerian.
