Mr Joe Geddes, after whom the blue house is named, was one of the first pupils to start at Koch Street in 1889, having arrived in Johannesburg with his father, a miner. Geddes became a student teacher in the early 1890s, after just a few years at school, and stayed as a permanent teacher on completion of his training. According to material in the Marist Archive, Geddes lost his right hand in his youth but was reputed to have the best handwriting in the school. He was, according to the 75th Anniversary Maristonian (1964), a ‘landmark at the school’. His brother, Robert Geddes, also a Koch Street pupil, wrote in the 1926 Maristonian about Joe Geddes’ fervour for soccer, bowls and cricket and remembered how, at a young age, Joe narrowly escaped being attacked by a snake whilst on a trek. Robert Geddes wrote that his brother – a great character builder – should be remembered for embodying his life motto: ‘everything worth doing, is worth doing well’. Joe Geddes died in 1923. 

Though Joe Geddes was the first Sacred Heart alumni to become part of the teaching staff, he certainly wasn’t the last. Current alumni, now staff, include Mrs King (née Krause) and Mrs McCreesh (née Niken).
