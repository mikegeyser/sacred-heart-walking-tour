Benedict House is named for the Founder of the Marist Congregation, Marcellin Joseph Benedict Champagnat. It seems odd that the house should not instead have been named Marcellin. The explanation may lie in the fact that shortly before the school opened, the chapel was dedi¬cated by Bishop O'Leary to St. Benedict; documents in the Marist Archive suggest that the school originally opened as St. Benedict's (to differentiate from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street) and that the name was later changed to Sacred Heart Col¬lege, though Marist Brothers Observatory (or ‘Obs’) was used colloquially until the 1980s. Benedict House is the only house which didn’t exist at Koch Street – replacing Frederick House (Br Frederick was the first Principal).

Marcellin Champagnat was born in France in 1789 during a time of economic, spiritual and cultural unrest (the time of the French revolution and its socio-politically de-structured aftermath). Having pledged fidelity to the way of Mary as a spiritual and practical path with his co-ordained in 1816 as part of the “Society of Mary”, in 1817 Champagnat established the “little brothers of Mary” or Marist Brothers, a group of teaching brothers whose primary concern was the spiritual and educational nurture of young people, particularly for those who are least favoured by life.

Goyo painted this portrait in acrylic on a wood panel measuring 70 x 50cm in 1999\. Goyo was a Marist pupil in Spain from the age of 10 and a Brother in his twenties. Though he left the Institution he kept very close relations with his Marist family and in the late 1990s was asked to create a new portrait of Champagnat to be used for the Canonisation of St Marcellin. A large version of this portrait was displayed in St Peter’s Basilica, Rome when Champagnat was canonised in 1999\. A print of this portrait can be found, amongst other places around the school, hanging in the main school reception hall.
