Benedict House is named for the Founder of the Marist Brothers, Marcellin Joseph Benedict Champagnat. Marcellin Champagnat was born in France in 1789 during a time of economic, spiritual and cultural unrest (the time of the French Revolution and its aftermath) and on becoming a priest, dedicated his life’s mission to the foundation of a teaching brotherhood. Marist Brothers first arrived in South Africa in 1967 and established several schools, inspired by the example of their founder, Champagnat. 2017 marks the 150th anniversary of the Brothers’ arrival on the African continent and 200 years since the Marist Brothers started their mission. Champagnat was venerated by the Pope in 1955 and boys from both Sacred Heart Colleges (in Koch Street and at Observatory) and from St.David’s College, Inanda attended a special Mass held at City Hall to honour this. 

Shortly before the College opened in Observatory, the Chapel was dedicated to St. Benedict by Bishop O'Leary. The College was most likely first named St. Benedict's, to differentiate it from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street. The name Sacred Heart College was only officialised by the 1930s, though Marist Brothers Observatory (or ‘Obs’) was used colloquially until the 1980s. This might explain why the green house is called Benedict, and not Marcellin or Champagnat. Benedict House is the only house that didn’t exist at Koch Street; it replaced Frederick House (Br Frederick was the first Principal).
