Benedict House is named for the Founder of the Marist Brothers, Marcellin Joseph Benedict Champagnat. Shortly before the College opened, the Chapel was dedicated by Bishop O'Leary to St. Benedict and documents in the Marist Archive suggest that the College originally opened as St. Benedict's to differentiate from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street. The name Sacred Heart College was only officialised by the 1930s, though Marist Brothers Observatory (or ‘Obs’) was used colloquially until the 1980s. This might explain why the house is called Benedict and not Marcellin or Champagnat. Benedict House is the only house which didn’t exist at Koch Street; it replaced Frederick House (Br Frederick was the first Principal). 

Goyo painted this portrait in acrylic on a wood panel measuring 70 x 50cm in 1999. Goyo was a Marist pupil in Spain from the age of 10 and a Brother in his twenties. Though he left the Institution he kept very close relations with his Marist family and in the late 1990s was asked to create a new portrait of Champagnat to be used for the Canonisation of St Marcellin. A large version of this portrait printed on canvas was displayed in St Peter’s Basilica, Rome when Champagnat was canonised in 1999. A print of this portrait can be found, amongst other places around the school, hanging in the main school reception hall.
