O’Leary House is named after the Rt. Rev David O’Leary, Bishop (or Vicar Apostolic of the Transvaal Vicariate) of the then Transvaal at the time that the school was opened in Observatory; he blessed the college chapel and officiated at the opening ceremony for the new school. O.M.I denotes his membership of the The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, another Catholic congregation founded by Eugene de Mazenod in 1816, a contemporary of Marcellin Champagnat. O’Leary was born in Kimberley in 1880 and attended the Marist Brothers’ College in Uitenhage. During the first world war, O’Leary served as military chaplain to the Allied Forces in East Africa. O’Leary was an active ‘Old Boy’ for the Marists – he played cricket for their teams and also is reported to have enjoyed soccer. O’Leary was the first South African to form part of the Episcopacy (the Church government) and was honoured by the Vatican with the positions of Papal Count and Assistant to the Pontifical Throne. 

In the 1958 Maristonian, published in the year of his death, notes that “St. David’s College, Inanda, which has been named after him and O’Leary House at Observatory will help to keep ever green the memory of a great friend and counsellor.”
