O’Leary House, the yellow house, is named after the Rt. Rev David O’Leary, Bishop (or Vicar Apostolic of the Transvaal) of the then Transvaal at the time that the school was opened in Observatory; he blessed the College Chapel and officiated at the opening ceremony for the new school. O.M.I denotes his membership of the The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, another Catholic congregation founded in 1816 by Eugene de Mazenod, a contemporary of Marcellin Champagnat. O’Leary, born in Kimberley in 1880, attended the Marist Brothers’ College in Uitenhage. During WW1, O’Leary served as military Chaplain to the Allied Forces in East Africa. O’Leary enjoyed soccer and played cricket for the Marist Old Boys’ team. He was the first South African to join the Episcopacy (the Church government) and was honoured by the Vatican with the positions of Papal Count and Assistant to the Pontifical Throne.

O’Leary died in 1958. The Maristonian noted, “St. David’s College, Inanda, which has been named after him and O’Leary House at Observatory will help to keep ever green the memory of a great friend and counsellor.”
