These enamel and metal badges (measuring approx. 1.5 x 2 cm) were worn on the left hand lapel of the blazer. Pictures can be found in the Maristonian of learners wearing these badges between the years of c.1928-1942. It is likely that post WW2, when finances were tight, that these were phased out, for this reason. This collection of badges was donated to Museum Africa in 1951. 

The Marist AM monogram is centred in the badge, with the house name written in the scroll below the monogram. The coloured background is specific to each house. Above the monogram is a single star; alluding to Mary, the Marist’s guiding star like the star of Bethlehem for the Magi (in Biblical texts). The “J” below the monogram signifies either Johannesburg or Junior Marist (categorised as pupils in standards 1 to 5, equivalent of grades 2-6 today). It is most likely Johannesburg as, prior to 1933 (when the Brothers’ Council first allowed the different Marist schools in South Africa to wear different blazers), Marist uniforms between schools were distinguished only by a metal badge, similar to the above, with a letter denoting the school, for example: MBR for Marist Brothers Rondebosch and MBD for Marist Brothers Durban.
