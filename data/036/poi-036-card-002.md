These enamel and metal badges (measuring approx. 1.5 x 2 cm) were worn in the left hand lapel. Pictures can be found in the Maristonian of learners wearing these badges between the years of c.1928-1942. It is likely that post World War Two, when finances were tight, that these were phased out for this reason. This collection of badges was donated to Museum Africa in 1951. 

The Marist AM monogram is centred in the badge, with the house name written in the scroll below the monogram. The coloured background is specific to each house. Above the monogram is a single star; alluding to Mary, the Marist’s guiding star like as the star of Bethlehem for the Magi (in Biblical texts) and referring to the single star in the House of David’s crest to which Jesus’ ancestry is ascribed. The “J” below the monogram signifies either Johannesburg or Junior Marist (categorised as pupils in standards 1 to 5, equivalent of grades 2-6 today). It is most likely Johannesburg as, prior to 1933 (when the Brother’s Council’s resolution allowed for non-standardisation of Marist blazers amongst the South African schools), Marist uniforms between schools were distinguished by a metal badge, similar to the above, with a slight change in lettering to denote the school. For example, MBR for Marist Brothers Rondebosch and MBD for Marist Brothers Durban.
