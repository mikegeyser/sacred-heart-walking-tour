These enamel and metal badges (c. 1.5 x 2 cm) were worn on the blazer’s left hand lapel. Pictures in the Maristonian show learners wearing these between the years of c.1928-1942. Post WW2, when finances were tight, the badges were phased out, though they were reintroduced for a period of time between the 1950s and ‘70s. This collection was donated to Museum Africa in 1951. 

The Marist AM monogram is centred in the badge, with the house name written in the scroll below the monogram. The coloured background is specific to each house. Above the monogram is a single star; alluding to Mary, the Marist’s guiding star like the star of Bethlehem for the Magi (in Biblical texts). The “J” below the monogram signifies either Johannesburg or Junior Marist (categorised as pupils in standards 1 to 5, equivalent of grades 2-6 today). It is most likely Johannesburg as, prior to 1933 (when the Brothers’ Council first allowed the different Marist schools in South Africa to wear different blazers), Marist uniforms between schools were distinguished only by a metal badge, similar to the above, with a letter denoting the school, for example: MBR for Marist Brothers Rondebosch and MBD for Marist Brothers Durban.
