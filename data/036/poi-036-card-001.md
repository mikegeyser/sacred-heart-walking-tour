Flags for the four school houses at Koch Street - Frederick (far left), Geddes (second left), Valerian (third left) and O’Leary (second from right), a flag for Marist Brothers College (third from right), and a flag with an obscured symbol, possibly the Sacred Heart (far right)."

Though this image from 1939, is in black and white, one can just about make out the hues of the colours of the four school houses – the colours still used today. Each flag has a single letter which denotes the house; Frederick in green, Geddes in blue, Valerian in red and O’Leary in yellow. At Observatory, Frederick House was replaced by Benedict House.

The Marist Brothers flag consists of the letters A and M intertwined, the Marist monogram representing their motto Ad Jesum per Mariam (To Jesus through the way of Mary). AM as a Catholic monogram (usually standing for Ave Maria – praise/hail Mary) is not unique to the Marist Brothers but AM in this distinctive yellow and blue script is internationally associated with the Marist Congregation. Underneath the monogram is a scroll with the letters M.B.C. (Marist Brothers College), and underneath these further letters, most likely JHB.

The sixth flag is not absolutely identifiable in this picture. Perhaps it contains the Sacred Heart emblem. This was first flown above the Koch Street school in the French flag, hoisted by Br Frederick to demonstrate the neutrality of the hospital-cum-school during the second Anglo-Boer war in 1900\. Another, more likely, possibility is that it contained the logo of the Old Boys Association (see POI 36, card 2) as these flags were presented by the Old Boys Association.

Second from right is W. Singleton, pupil at Koch Street and then teacher at Observatory and later first librarian when the purpose-built library was added to Sacred Heart College in 1961\.

Learners at the school, from pre-primary to matric, are divided amongst the four school houses; with siblings allocated to the same houses. The house system is most visible during sports events; particularly at the annual swimming galas and athletics meets. At these, and at other house associated events, the learners wear their assigned house coloured t-shirts.
