Here there are six flags; one each for the four school houses at Koch Street, a flag for the Marist Brothers’ College (third from right) and one with an obscured symbol, possibly the Sacred Heart (far right).  Though the image is in black and white, one can just about make out the hues of the colours of the four school houses; the colours still used today. Each flag has a single letter denoting the house; **F**rederick (in green, far left), **G**eddes (in blue, second left), **V**alerian (in red, third left) and **O**’Leary (in yellow, second from right). At Observatory, Frederick House was replaced by Benedict House.

The Marist Brothers flag shows the letters A and M intertwined, a monogram representing their motto Ad Jesum per Mariam (To Jesus through the way of Mary). AM as a Catholic monogram (standing for Ave Maria – praise/hail Mary) is not unique to the Marist Brothers but, in the distinctive gold and blue script is internationally associated with the Marist Congregation. Under the monogram is a scroll with the letters M.B.C. (Marist Brothers College), with the letters JHB for Johannesburg underneath. The sixth flag is not clearly identifiable. It might feature the Sacred Heart emblem, first flown above the Koch Street school within the French flag, hoisted by Br Frederick to demonstrate the neutrality of the hospital-cum-school during the second South African War in 1900. Another possibility is that it showed the logo of the Old Boys Association as these flags were presented by the Old Boys’ Association. 

Second from right is W. Singleton, Koch Street alumnus, then teacher at Observatory and later librarian when the purpose-built library was added to the College in 1961. Learners at the school, from Pre-Primary to Matric, are divided amongst the four school houses. Siblings are allocated the same houses. The house system is most visible during sports events. At these, and at other house associated events, the learners wear their assigned house coloured t-shirts.
