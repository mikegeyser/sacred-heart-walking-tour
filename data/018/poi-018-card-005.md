  text: "Today the Primary School children sometimes play with marbles in the Foundation Quad – supposedly only at break times. In earlier days at the College, certainly between the 1940s and 1960s, this area between the Memorial Chapel and where the Science Block now stands was known by the boys as the best place to play. "

This photograph, captioned “venue for the annual ‘Marble Season’” was posted on the Sacred Heart/Marist Obs Alumni Facebook page by Howard Thomas, matric in 1963. He took a series of photographs in his final year at the College on a Brownie Box camera, including this one. Howard Thomas is not the only alumnus to recall marbles being a part of school life. Edward Joffe, a pupil in the 1940s, described the following in his memoirs:
> “The marbles site was the driveway between the buildings and the main rugby field. Proximity to the classrooms enabled us to extract every last moment of playing time before the bell summoned us back to lessons. The area was sheltered by pine trees and riddled with small shallow craters used to play holey-holey at which the Portuguese guys were particularly skilled. This game was vaguely reminiscent of billiards without the cue and demanded remarkable dexterity.”
