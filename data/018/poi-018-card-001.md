For sometime, the steady increase in the number of students seeking admission into the College had emphasised the need for additional class-rooms and further staff accommodation, so to meet this need, Mr. E. L. Keenor, the architect who had planned the wing added in 1931, designed a two-storey block of twelve classrooms with an exterior that matched the already established College buildings. He was careful to provide in his plans for the latest improvements in acoustics and comfort.

In addition to the twelve classroom block built under Mr. A Bennett in 1935, a gamesroom, extra lodgings for the support staff, and a bicycle shed with racks for some 170 bicycles, were constructed by Mr. J. E. Morren.

Two days before the re-opening of the College, which took place that year on the 28th of January, the new buildings were blessed by His Excellency the Rt. Rev. Bishop O'Leary, O.M.I, and dedicated to the Christian education of youth. He was assisted in the ceremony by Rev. Fathers E. Roux, O.M.I., and Abramo, O.M.I, of Yeoville and Kerk Street parishes.
