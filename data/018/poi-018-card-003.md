The Knights of the Altar were a society established by Brother Otto whilst posted on mission to a Marist school in China in 1938\. Their function was, as a group of boys who were responsible for duties assisting Ministers during Mass, “to form a worthy guard of honour of our Divine Eucharistic King”. The Knights of the Altar were first established in South Africa at Obs in 1960 and then after in other Marist schools in the Republic. Brother Otto is pictured centre in this image, with D. Ball (Supreme Grand Knight) to his left and P. Abraham (Vice-Supreme Grand Knight) to his right.
