    <p>This plaque found in the school hall is a memorial to Koch Street Old Boys who died in service during WW1 (1914-1918). The plaque was erected by the Old Boys Association in memory of their peers. There are 49 names listed and is emblazoned with the Marist International crest and two springboks, the symbol used South African soldiers in WW1. The Koch Street exam records list every boy who sat for Matriculation. G. Adler, the first alphabetically listed, was a Matric in 1910. A. Freedman, Matric 1911; A. Rennie, Matric 1912. The 1912 Maristonian describes some of its Old Boys; G.O.Veit who was born in 1890 (thus between 24 and 28 when he was killed in action) as a solicitor who still enjoyed cricket and hockey. Each one of the 49 will have been recorded school annals; mentioned here are but four. The year in which they sat Matric a stark reminder of the youths that they were when these 49 Marist boys were killed in action.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The motto was that of the Union of South Africa, post 1910, and referred to the strength perceived to have been created when combining the Boer Republics (Transvaal and Orange Free State) with the two British Colonies (Cape and Natal) and signified the union of Afrikaans and English speaking South Africans in a common South African identity. The nickname “Springboks” stayed with South African servicemen and women throughout the First and Second World Wars. Today it is a nickname more readily associated with South African sports teams.</p>
<p>The South African Infantry Brigade was formed of four battalions. Soldiers from the then Transvaal, hence Marist boys from Sacred Heart College in Koch Street, would have formed part of either the 3rd regiment or 4th regiments.</p>
