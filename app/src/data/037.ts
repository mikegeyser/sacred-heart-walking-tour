    <p>The room known to learners and staff as the Pulse Media Centre, situated in the Marcia Hyam Library, started off as the Boarders’ Refectory (dining room) when the College opened in 1926. One of the first Chefs at the college was Ephraim Letebele, who started at the school in 1934 and stayed until his retirement in 1974, coinciding with the end of the boarding at the College. His kitchen was situated behind the high school tuck-shop. Ephraim Letebele’s legacy at the school carries on today – his grandchildren and great-grandchildren have passed through the school as learners and his son, Joseph Letebele, who started as College Handyman in 1961 is an indispensable part of the Maintenance Staff. The Letebele Music Centre which was opened in 2002 was named for this family’s association with and contribution to Sacred Heart College.</p>

    <p>The food served in the Refectory was adjusted seasonally; a menu for summer and one for winter. Year round, as in most Christian (especially Catholic) institutions, fish was served on Fridays. During the war years (1930s-1940s), when provisions were in shorter supply and budget was restricted, the main staple was corned beef. The Chef served it curried, fried, minced with rice, cold with salad at lunch or hashed with potatoes. Eggs and porridge were served at breakfast.</p>
<p>The boarders were fond of condiments like piccalilli, tomato sauce, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce, and a separate table was laden with the boys&#39; personal supplies. Though some Brothers (named Crows by the boys) were on duty in the Refectory at meal times, the rest ate in a separate dining room (now Habits, the Coffee Shop). The interconnecting door between the two dining rooms is still functional. The Brothers shared a menu with the boys, albeit with a few extras here and there.</p>
<p>The archive has menus from celebratory dinners, for example, the 1951 Golden Jubilee Dinner of the Marist Old Boys’ Association. ‘Spaghetti mince soufflé’ was followed by ‘Fruit in jelly with custard’ and likely similar to the meals they were served whilst still at school.</p>

    <p>The dining room would have seated 80-100 boys. Each table seated eight and was arranged with a Table Captain and Vice-Captain, who were senior boys appointed to be in charge of behaviour and the serving of food. Some recalled this system to have been less than democratic and the portions received reflective of this. Not unimaginable was the hierarchical system that it created and the likely disproportionate rationing of food between boys of different ages. E. Joffe’s memoir, “Before Mandela’s Rainbow”, reflected on the boarders’ delight at supplementing their meals from the dining room with offerings from the day boys’ packed lunches and with trips to the shops in Yeoville. Of course this latter possibility was only a privilege available to the older boys, who were able to leave the school grounds for such excursions.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>When the College first opened there was no stand-alone library. There was a small bookshelf available for the Boarders only in the New Wing (added in 1931). In 1937 the City Council presented the school with an oak bookcase (which is still in the Media Centre today) to celebrate the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. During the 1940s and 50s appeals were made by the P.T.A. (now P.A. and prior to 1960s The Ladies’ Association) for donations to grow the library, which was managed by the Brothers and was still for boarders only. </p>
<p>By the 1960s all boys were allowed to use the lending library. In 1969 the increased number of books necessitated an upgrade to the space and the school library was built between the chapel and the Junior Primary Quad. When the Senior Primary (or Intermediate Quad) was added at the end of the 1980s and the library was converted into classrooms for the junior pupils, the Refectory (now defunct because there were no more boarders at the school) was turned into the Senior Library. The Primary School used, as still today, the purpose-built library in the Intermediate Quad basement. </p>

    <p>Dr Marcia Hyam, neé Warmback, after whom the Library is named, and her two brothers had a long connection with the school. André and Patrick attended Yeoville Convent until Standard 3 when they moved to Marist ‘Obs’. André, a school Cadet member, joined the South African Air Force. In 1945 whilst flying a Lancaster Bomber, he went missing after a raid on Italy, presumed killed.</p>
<p>In 1938, in Standard 9 at Yeoville Convent, Marcia and two other girls had parts in the Sacred Heart College production, &#39;Abraham Lincoln&#39; by John Drinkwater. Her Headmistress insisted that the girls were chaperoned to and from rehearsals at the College; records show that 66 boys volunteered their services!</p>
<p>Dr Marcia Hyam taught at Yeoville Convent 27 years. From 1980 she taught maths at Sacred Heart College, heading the Department for ten years until her retirement and emigration to Australia in 1992. Dr Hyam played the piano and organ at school events and composed the music and lyrics for the school song. The 1992 Sacred Heart College yearbook recalls her incredible drive, her wrangles with College management and dedication to her students as well as her often used catchphrases, including: </p>
<p>&quot;Just because you are in maths, doesn&#39;t mean you only have to learn mathematics.&quot; 
&quot;Don&#39;t sit and wait for better days. They won&#39;t come. You must make them NOW!&quot; 
&quot;Mommy and Nanny didn&#39;t pack your calculator today.&quot;  </p>

    <p>In 2012 the Marcia Hyam Library was redesigned for 21st century learners. The design, including an AV room, a think tank that can be secluded with curtains, access to digital reference books and a reading zone were put together by André Croucamp of MindBurst; College parent Bea Roberts, and architect Nabeel Essa. The centre was named Pulse after a workshop with learners at the school and reflects its essence, heart, connectedness and sensitivity to world rhythms and dynamics. </p>
<p>The funding for the new centre was provided by Zwelakhe Sisulu (who died three weeks before the centre opened) and the Friends of Eric Molobi, reflecting the mutual association of these struggle activists and the College; connected in their personal narratives but also through their dedication to freedom of information, access to education and the fight for social justice. The Sisulu and Molobi families both have long and involved relations with the school from the 1960s, which continue to this day. </p>
