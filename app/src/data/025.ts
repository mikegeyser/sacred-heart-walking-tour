    furtherText: `
    <p>The tradition of the ‘March On’ for both inter-house athletics and swimming galas goes back to the beginning days at Observatory as evidenced in this photograph and most likely came as an ‘imported’ tradition from Koch Street when the boys used to ‘march to’ The Wanderers and Union Grounds to use sports facilities. Pre 1975, the Cadet Band in full military regalia with mace, drums and bugles would lead the school in a march to the strains of “Marching to Georgia” and “A hunting we will go” to t inter-house events. The band accompaniment came to an end when the Cadets were phased out and a Sousa march was played out from the loudspeakers instead as is still the case today, along with music of the moment as selected by the matrics of that year. </p>

    <p>The March On tradition continues to this day as part of the Inter-House Athletics meet in September. Athletics has always been one of the major sports at the College with all learners taking part, at whatever level is suited to their ability. Brother Callixte was recognised by the South African Athletics Union for his contribution to the sport in the early 1900s and made a life member due to the way Koch Street produced so many talented athletes – and this was despite having no facilities of their own (when Observatory was built the boys traveled there to use them). Many South African Athletes learnt their early skills on this cinder track (which was sprinkled with sawdust so it could be used after rains) – today the track is grass and the College continues to produce athletes who compete nationally. </p>

    <p>The picture above shows an athletics meet from the late 1940s and the smoke from the starting gun is visible. Brother Mario recalls an incident during the 1960s in which Br Andrew, who came from Inanda to prepare for an inter school swimming gala, was preparing the starting gun for use. Convinced that the selected ammunition was blank, he demonstrated by taking aim at a 44-gallon drum positioned at time on one of the traffic islands in front of the College, inside which was a garden hose. The hosepipe thereafter became a very long sprinkler system and for safety measures it was decided that the starting gun in swimming galas would be replaced with a whistle. The gun has been retained only for athletics – and only blanks are kept on site!</p>

    <p>The College War Cry goes back at least to the 1940s, if not before. The boys imitated what was prevalent in society at the time and war cries were (and are) not unique to Sacred Heart College. However, each school’s war cry is unique but unfortunately the origins of the wording to Sacred Heart’s are unknown. The school’s official war cry is called ‘Rammy, Rammy, Ramson’:</p>
<p>Leaders: Rammy, Rammy, Ramson

Leaders: Rusting Culi Ruli Ra

<p>Of course, the war cry is not a prelude to outbursts of violence at the College - a war cry in a civilian sense is understood as a cue to rally around a particular cause. The 1999 SRC report stated that a weekly war cry practice was introduced by the ‘Spirit Committee’ to teach the war cries and promote school spirit – for until the mid 1980s every boy knew the lyrics as it was regularly chanted at rugby matches by the crowd by way of encouragement to the players. In 2011 the LLC coined the practices ‘War Cry Wednesday’ and the cries can be heard at swimming galas and athletics fixtures, at the end of special assemblies and other spirit raising events today.</p>

    <p>When the College opened to boys in 1926 several cricket fields were laid out, having been blasted flat and cleared of granite rocks by Brother Henry and his maintenance team. In 1940 the College Cricket Oval was created and turf wickets laid; the existing Kikuyu grass was removed and Magennis grass was planted. In 1941 the Oval was opened in the presence of the Mayor, Lady Mayoress, several City Councilors and a number of Old Boys (including Springbok cricketers Syd Curnow and C.N. Frank). </p>

    <p>The Transvaal FA was formed in 1889 and not only did the boys at Koch Street play soccer in school as their main winter sport but, together with the Old Boys they formed their own A.F.C (Association Football Club) which played league matches within the Transvaal FA. Marist Brothers (and there was an equivalent Marist team in the Western Province) dominated the league until the 1960s and the advent of professional soccer. In 1955, Marist Brothers (in the Transvaal FA) won 19 trophies, including every league championship title in the province from Under 14 to the senior Transvaal League - an all-time record.  As of 1974 10% of Springbok Soccer players were old boys from Marist schools in South Africa. </p>
<p>Sacred Heart College at Koch Street, and at Observatory, were renowned for their soccer teams and their reputation as leaders in the sport. The early impetus for likely came from Scottish immigrants to South Africa, who influenced by Brother Walfrid, an Irish Marist Brother who founded the famous Celtic Football Club in Glasgow (as a poverty outreach project in the 1880s) sought Marist schools for their soccer playing sons. Indeed, the Brothers, though many enjoyed the sport of rugby and taught it, were known for their preference for soccer as a socially unifying and accessible game. </p>

    <p>For fifty years at Sacred Heart College soccer was relegated by rugby to a secondary sport. From the 1980s it regained popularity amongst the boys, perhaps due to its following amongst the newly admitted black students for whom soccer had always been a major game and in 1982 the school officially recognised a senior team who represented the College against other schools in matches. Today there are both girls’ and boys’ Soccer teams. </p>
<p>The 1934 Maristonian noted the move to rugby with the following words::</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“King Soccer&#39;s long reign at the College has come to an end, and this may be well termed its obituary notice. Its term of sovereignty has been a long and an honourable one, and has left an indelible mark upon the history of the game in the Transvaal and in South Africa. Some of the most famous players who have represented this country have received their first coaching while at the School, among these perhaps the best known being Jock Ritchie, Freddie Mitchell and the Lowe brothers. Its passing will be regretted by many who almost regard the Marist Brothers&#39; College and Soccer as inseparable, but factors beyond the control of the Brothers have made the change to rugby unavoidable. The latter has, however, been set a standard to reach and a tradition to equal.”</p>
