    <p>Born in Ireland in 1889 (Christopher Hagan) Br Macartin arrived in South Africa in 1920. He taught at several of the Marist schools including Sacred Heart College at Koch Street, Uitenhage and Pietermaritzburg but it was at Observatory that he spent most of his teaching career both in the classroom, on the sports field and with the Cadet Corps. He was headmaster of five of the South African Marist schools in South Africa during his career.</p>
<p>Brother Macartin was decorated with several medals, some of which are pictured here. These included one awarded by Queen Elizabeth II for services to education, the King George medal for long and meritorious service as a Cadet Officer, a medal for being the best at Musketry in the British Empire, the African Medal for services on the Home Front during the Second World War and a gold medallion sent by Pope John Paul II when Brother Macartin had served 70 years as a Brother. </p>

    <p>Brother Macartin, for whom the sports centre is named, was a celebrated teacher and sportsman (soccer and cricket) until an accident slightly lamed him. As a result he was nicknamed “Hoppy” by the boys. When too elderly to coach sports but before his retirement to Nazareth House he was to be found polishing and ordering the school sports equipment in “Hoppy’s Hole” (now the Alumni and Marketing Office). He was not the only Brother with a zeal for sport but his death, in 1990, was timeous with the construction of the new sports and community centre. </p>
<p>Brother Macartin could also be considered as one of the pioneers of Marist ‘Obs”. In c. 1918 Brother Macartin, taking a Sunday stroll with some of his peers, came across the land at Eckstein Street and remarked it would be a suitable site on which to enlarge their school. Since the sports facilities were inadequate at Koch Street it was the idea of expansive playing fields that particularly caught Br Macartin’s attention. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>During the 1930s and 1940s thousands of Catholics from all over the Johannesburg area congregated at Sacred Heart College in Observatory to celebrate the feast of Corpus Christi. As is traditional, Corpus Christi (a celebration of the bodily presence of Jesus in the Eucharistic service) is celebrated on the second Sunday after Pentecost, approximately six weeks after Easter. The festival was marked with a procession, Mystery Plays and with the celebration of the Eucharist at several points around the college grounds. One altar for this purpose was set up in the arched entrance to the swimming pool – seen in this image with the double columns on either side of the archway.</p>
<p>This entrance to the swimming pool is still in existence at Sacred Heart College though its position has since moved and its structure adapted; the building of the Macartin Centre alongside the swimming pool area meant that the entrance to the pool shifted westwards. You will notice the same gate from the 1930s has been incorporated into an adapted gateway to the swimming pool today.</p>
<p>The Macartin Centre and Memorial Chapel were constructed on this same garden area that could hold thousands of people at the Corpus Christi festival. When the Memorial Chapel was built this area became a landscaped lawn shaded by trees serving as a meditational space.  In 1969, the College Library was added. This is the extension that comes off the cloistered walk way to the Chapel and contains Foundation Phase classrooms today. </p>

    <p>The Brother Macartin Indoor Sports &amp; Community Centre was officially opened on 18th July 1992 by The Right Reverend, Reginald Orsmond, Bishop of Johannesburg. Linda Giuricich (née Woock)) taught PE and Standard 3 for 20 years (for 6 years she was Principal of the Foundation Phase then located at Yeoville Convent). Linda organised the Cultural Festival (forerunner of the Heritage Day Music festival) and the opening of the Macartin Centre. </p>
<p>Linda Giuricich is the granddaughter of Richard Hurly after whose farm Hurlyvale, Edenvale is named. Generations of both the Hurly and Giuricich families attended Koch Street, Marist ‘Obs’ and Yeoville Convent. Richard’s six sons and brother, Henry Hurly, attended Sacred Heart College. Of their sons, Richard (junior), was Head Boy and another, Charles, a Springbok soccer player. Ten grandchildren and great-grandchildren followed suite. </p>
<p>Giuricich Brothers (builders) brought earth to level some of the school playing fields from that removed when building Rosebank Mall in the 1960s. Linda’s grandmother, Myrtle Hurly, chaired The Ladies’ Committee that raised the funds to build The Memorial Chapel. Linda recalls that her grandfather Richard Hurly received the first Marist Brothers by Ox Wagon in 1887, as they stopped at the Hurly dairy farm before reaching Johannesburg from Kimberley. Today Linda runs Aerials Rhythmic Gymnastics club, operating at the school since 1980. 2006 Springbok gymnasts, and Sacred Heart alumni, Chantal Moonsammy and Nadia Harris were her students.  Three current learners, who train at Aerials represent Gauteng with one, Sara Feldman, winning South African titles for four consecutive years. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Macartin Centre is foremost a sports hub but has many other uses in line with its original purposing as a Sports and Community Centre. Several times a year whole school Masses are held in the space – for it is the only indoor space large enough to hold the Pre-Primary, Primary, High School and Three2Six schools that make up Sacred Heart College. </p>
<p>Masses such as these are held to celebrate Sacred Heart Day in memory of Marcellin Champagnat on 6th June as well as Academic Masses at the start and end of each year. A tradition that has been in place for many years is the walking in of the oldest and youngest main school pupils which is a physical reminder of the strength of relations between pupils of all stages in their careers at Sacred Heart College. On this day cool drinks and sticky buns are served as a treat to learners. This tradition goes right back to the Koch Street days. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>This logo which is the emblem for sports teams at Sacred Heart College was devised by alumni Paul Swart (matric 1989) during his time at the school. Swart went on to become an architect after his time at Sacred Heart. 1989 was the first year that swimmers from Sacred Heart College swam the Midmar Mile (the world’s largest open water swim that takes place in February each year) coached by Veronica Sandham, then PE teacher, and the swimming team wanted something to put on their team t-shirts to mark this event. The dolphin was suggested by Franco Gilardi (alumnus and later PE teacher) and since the late 1980s has been particularly associated with Sacred Heart College’s swimmers and basketball players (though the emblem represents all school teams). The same logo is to be found on the flooring of Macartin Centre as well as mosaicked onto the bottom of the swimming pool.  </p>
