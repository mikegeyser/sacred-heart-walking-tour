    <p>This physical archive is ordered in columned shelving in a small room (c. 4m x 2m), and can be visited by appointment with permission of the Marist Brothers. This rich store of information relating to the heritage of the wider Marist community is not practically accessible to a large audience. The collective archive of the Marist Brothers and of the Sacred Heart College community is however more than this particular physical space. Along with the actual items contained in this space, stories relating to the heritage of the Marists and Sacred Heart are held in the fabric of the buildings, the memories of its members and in the narrative threads that link them all together.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>St. Joseph’s Academy (a fee-paying school) was set up in 1867 alongside another Marist School, St Aloysius’ School (financed by the colonial government). At Sacred Heart College the model of a free/fee-paying school running concurrently is seen through the provision of bursaries for some learners and through the Three2Six Education Project for refugee children; it is foundational to the Marist ethos. The example page from the Accounts Ledger of St Joseph’s Academy lists purchases by the Brothers in 1872 as including library books, ink mats, 20lbs of chocolate, 2 pigs and ½ lb of snuff.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>In those early days of Johannesburg explosions related to mining were not infrequent. In 1896, at Braamfontein station, an explosives train carrying c.60 tons of dynamite, which had been stood for several days in the sun was struck by a shunting train. A crater 60m x 50m x 8m was created by the blast (heard up to 200 km away) and some 300 people were killed or seriously injured. </p>
<p>In the 1930 Maristonian, Koch Street alumnus C.H.Holden recalled the 1896 blast;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It was just about 3.20 in the afternoon of the 19th February – Ash Wednesday – that, while Brother Kieran was taking class, the windows were suddenly blown in. Of course we were all for dashing out to see what it meant but Brother Kieran would not let us go until closing time… I arrived home to find the roof of our house lifted some inches of the wall. This was however a trifle compared to the desolation nearer the scene of the explosion.”</p>

    <p>The ‘amazing discoveries’ that Professor Tobias refers to in his letter are likely to have been the Little Foot skeleton (fossil StW 573), parts of which were found in 1980, but it was only in 1994 that Little Foot was declared a hominid, one of the first early ancestors of man to walk upright. In 1997 the missing pieces of the skeleton were found deep inside one of the caves, the Silberberg Grotto.</p>

    <p>During their impromptu meeting Professor Tobias told the Grade 7s about the Marist connection to the caves. He assumed Guglielmo Martinaglia, an Italian immigrant to Johannesburg, he assumed had become associated with the Brothers through his Catholic faith (he is buried in the Roman Catholic cemetery in Burgershoop, Krugersdorp, only a few miles from the Sterkfontein Caves). It is possible that his son had been enrolled at Koch Street, though no record of a boy by that surname exists in the annals. Perhaps the visit reminded Professor Tobias to return the photo of the Brothers visiting the caves, as by then he’d had it by then in his possession for several years!</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Jordan was born Michael Mengele in Bavaria (Germany) and aged 13 entered the Marist Juniorate at Grugliasco in Italy. As a young boy he would have heard the same bell tolling that is rung by the Grade 1s and Grade 12s to mark their entry into and exit from the College; for the Marist Bell was brought from Italy at the request of Brother Jordan to be installed in the newly built Memorial Chapel in 1956. </p>
<p>Brother Jordan came to South Africa in 1937, teaching at all but one of the Marist schools and serving as a Provincial Councillor and Superior in his time. During his years as Principal of the College, Brother Jordan researched the history of the Marist Brothers and Holy Family Sisters from their beginnings and later their presence in South Africa (until the 1950s). The former piece of research is kept in the Marist Archive and has been used as background to many a piece in the Maristonian and College yearbooks. </p>

    <p>Born Ian Anthony Whiteford, in 1936 (in Johannesburg), Brother Martin was a learner at St Joseph’s College in Rondebosch from 1945-1953 where his family moved after the end of the Second World War. Marist Archivist for over 20 years until shortly before his death in 2013, he meticulously ordered and assembled the Archival material kept in the room at Observatory. In the latter years of this work Brother Martin had begun to digitalise many of the photographs and documentation kept in the archive and, in addition, he amassed biographies for almost every Brother appointed to and in South Africa since 1867. </p>
<p>Brother Martin taught Religious Education, Geography, the Cadets and some sports at Sacred Heart College from the 1970s until the mid 1980s. He was also responsible for retreats and pastoral care for both learners and staff at each of the schools he was involved with. He later he moved to St. Henry’s, Durban, and then into the Archivist role.</p>
