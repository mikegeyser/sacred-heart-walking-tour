    <p>This physical archive is ordered in columned shelving in a small room (approx. 4m x 2m), can be accessed by appointment with permission of the Marist Brothers. The contents of this archive is not widely known of; only a few have the time, reason and inclination to access its rich store of information relating to the heritage of the wider Marist community. The collective archive of the Marist Brothers and of the Sacred Heart College community however is more than this particular physical space. Along with the actual items contained in this space, stories relating to the heritage of the Marists and Sacred Heart are held in the fabric of the buildings, the memories of its members and in the narrative threads that link them all together.</p>

This was a fee-paying school that was set up concurrently with a free school, St Aloysius’ School (financed by the colonial government) by the Marist Brothers. This model of a free school and fee paying school running concurrently has been replicated time and again by the Marist Brothers and enables their mission as outlined by Champagnat to educate particularly those children at the margins of society. At fee-paying Sacred Heart College this pattern is followed in several ways, through bursaries for some learners attending the College and through the Three2Six Education Project for refugee children.",

<p>This page from the Accounts Ledger of St Joseph’s Academy in Cape Town records that amongst other purchases by the Brothers such as library books and ink mats (no doubt for the learners) in 1872, the buying of 20lbs of chocolate, 2 pigs and ½ lb of snuff was recorded. It’s unlikely that these items would feature in the College accounts books today.</p>

    <p>In those early days of Johannesburg explosions related to mining were not infrequent. In 1896, at Braamfontein station, an explosives train carrying c.60 tons of dynamite, which had been stood for several days in the sun was struck by a shunting train. A crater 60m x 50m x 8m was created by the blast (heard up to 200 km away) and some 300 people were killed or seriously injured. </p>
<p>In the 1930 Maristonian, Koch Street alumnus C.H.Holden recalled the 1896 blast;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It was just about 3.20 in the afternoon of the 19th February – Ash Wednesday – that, while Brother Kieran was taking class, the windows were suddenly blown in. Of course we were all for dashing out to see what it meant but Brother Kieran would not let us go until closing time… I arrived home to find the roof of our house lifted some inches of the wall. This was however a trifle compared to the desolation nearer the scene of the explosion.”</p>

The late Professor Philip Tobias, one of South Africa’s most honoured and awarded scientists (nominated three times for a Nobel Prize) mused that the item that the Brother to the right of Martinaglia might have been the first fossil removed from the cave!",

    <p>The ‘amazing discoveries’ that Professor Tobias refers to in his letter are likely to have been the Little Foot skeleton (fossil StW 573), parts of which were found in 1980, but it was only in 1994 that Little Foot was declared a hominid, one of the first early ancestors of man to walk upright. In 1997 the missing pieces of the skeleton were found deep inside one of the caves, the Silberberg Grotto.</p>

<p>Grade 7s visit Sterkfontein Caves with Professor Tobias, Professor Ron Clarke and Dr Ali Bacher, 2000. Professor Tobias told the Grade 7s about the Marist connection to the caves. Perhaps the visit reminded Professor Tobias to return the photo he’d had for several years!</p>
