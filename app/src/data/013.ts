    <p>For Christians, particularly Catholics, the Sacred Heart of Jesus is an important symbol representing a physical manifestation of God’s divine love for all humanity. Particularly relevant to a Marist school, it echoes Champagnat’s vision of providing education for all children born out of equal love for them through the way of Mary, mother of Jesus. The school’s slogan is “Education with heart that knows no bounds”.</p>
<p>This photograph shows how the statue, positioned facing the College entrance steps, looks today. However, the statue previously stood in two other locations at Sacred Heart College. That the statue is now also painted with colours, unlike most other statues around the school, is also significant. The narratives around these changes are recounted in the following slides. This statue of Jesus is an object of much more than symbolising the College name; it is one that physically links Sacred Heart College to its ongoing mission to uphold its community members’ struggle for peace, equality and justice. </p>

<p>“Only a few days back a beautiful statue of the Sacred-Heart was erected over the entrance of the College. This emblem of the love of God for men is a most befitting image to dominate an institution placed under the patronage and the protection of the Son of God. From its niche it stretches forth its arms in welcome to all those who enter the College.”         (The 1932 Principal’s Report)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is speculation over why the niche was empty for the first few years of the Observatory College’s life. Perhaps it was originally intended to contain a statue of Marcellin Champagnat since in the early days the College was, briefly, called St Benedict’s in his honour. By the early thirties, though colloquially referred to as Marist Observatory, the school’s name was officially Sacred Heart College so the installation of this statue in this niche was a physical cementing of this fact. Today, in the niche, sits a copy of the statue of Our Lady of Good Hope. The original Our Lady of Good Hope statue is kept in the Brother’s residence.</p>

    <p>The statue of Jesus with the Sacred Heart was moved to this position by the gates in the late 1970s in preparation for the ‘new’ co-educational Sacred Heart College to open as an amalgamation of the three schools (Marist Observatory, St. Angela’s Convent in Kensington and Holy Family Convent, Yeoville) and symbolically welcomed people to this place of ‘love for all’. Sacred Heart College, the name of the school in which these three groups of learners would converge was already the name of the school but until that point not widely used by the school or wider community, who preferred to use the name Marist Observatory to distinguish it from the other Sacred Heart College in Koch street (then preparatory school for Sacred Heart College from 1926 until 1965), continuing out of habit for more than a decade after Koch street closed.</p>
<p>The last issue of the Maristonian, published in 1979 (replaced by the Sacred Heart College yearbook) paid tribute to the Marist Brothers, the Ursuline Sisters and the Holy Family sisters, now united in Sacred Heart College, under a picture of this statue already situated in its new location just inside the school gates. The statue was only to remain in this spot for about seven years. Events in 1987 necessitated restoration of the statue and resulted in the statue being moved to its current location today. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Neil McGurk, Principal of the college for 20 years was responsible for the transformative processes that Sacred Heart College began in the 1970s/80s (first with the admittance of black learners in 1976 and then in 1890 with co-education). The College was admitting Chinese learners from the 1930s and Brother Vincent recalls stories of these boys having to hide in cupboards from visiting government school inspectors, such was the nature of the school even prior to the 1970s.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Printed as if a warning to black students not to attend school in June 1897 this leaflet was likely created to give the impression that black students were behind the necklacing of the Sacred Heart Statue and intended to create discord within the community (both school and Marist) known for its inclusivity and racially mixed make-up. As Brother Neil’s account explains (heard in the previous slide) it was more likely printed and distributed by the (rogue) security forces and personally dropped by one Sergeant Beyers, who as if in some ironic-comic performance, was dispatched to the school the next morning when Brother Neil called the authorities to explain what had occurred at the school during the night. </p>
<p>The statue of Jesus was removed by Brother Neil and two colleagues that day in order to prevent the post-necklaced scaring the students (both white and black) coming into school. Brother Neil’s sister Geraldine restored the statue and painted it. The re-erection of the statue opposite the main steps was an act of defiance towards those responsible for the necklacing at the time – rather than discarding the burnt statue it was brought physically closer to the heart of the school demonstrating that ‘love for all’ was the true nature of the College.</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>“What has occurred at Khanya House is a tragedy, not only for the Bishops’ Conference but for the country as well. THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR POLITICAL POINT SCORING. It is a time for all South Africans to realise that violence will not solve the problems of the country.”</p>
<footer>Br Jude Pieterse, Sec. Gen. SACBC 1988</footer>

</blockquote>
<p>Wilfred Napier, President of the SACBC, described the attack as “an attempt to destroy the commitment and the spirit of justice, love and truth that inspired the Southern African Bishops’ Conference in its opposition to apartheid”. In part, it was the SACABC’s anti-apartheid vision that had inspired the Marists to open Sacred Heart to all races.  Brother Jude, former Marist Provincial and SACBC Secretary General at the time, relates that further unexploded triggers (including limpet mines) were found to have been planted in the Khanya House.
 The attack on Khanya House was the third similar of incident that year (after attacks on Cosatu House, the Trade Union Headquarters and Khosto House, the hub for the South African Council of Churches and other community activist organisations). The fear of the power of educational and spiritual related missions against the ideals of apartheid regime was palpable. The statue of Jesus with Sacred Heart remains a reminder of the transformative potential of that power. </p>
