    furtherText: `
    <p>Champagnat’s experience with the Montagne boy confirmed his calling to teach children, particularly those who didn’t know God’s love. Within a few months of the boy’s death, Champagnat had found two men willing to train as teachers and to follow in the way of Mary. Champagnat, curate of the village of La Valla, started a school and a foundation house for the three of them on 2 January 1817. The original house soon became too small and Notre Dame de L’Hermitage (depicted at bottom right of window as a red roofed building) was completed in 1825 to accommodate 100 Brothers.</p>
<p>Also visible is Champagnat’s signature, copied from his own handwriting. The violets – a tiny but strongly fragrant flower – symbolise the three virtues espoused by the Marist tradition, humility, simplicity, and modesty. The three nails allude to the crucifixion and the trade plied by the Marist Brothers in their early days, making nails. Their nearby town, St Etienne, was (and remains) a centre for metalwork. This window was gifted in 2000 by the Louriero family to celebrate their son Ricardo’s First Holy Communion in 1998. </p>

<p>&#39;Ordained a priest in 1816, I was assigned to a town in the district of St.-Chamond (Loire). What I saw with my own eyes in that new post, with reference to the education, reminded me of the difficulties I had experienced myself at their age, for lack of teachers.&#39;</p>

<p>Champagnat envisioned a brotherhood to tend to the educational and spiritual needs of children. Champagnat also employed a lay teacher at La Valla to support his teaching whilst he trained the two first Brothers. By the time of his death in 1840, only 23 years after the founding of the Marist Brothers, there were 278 Brothers in 48 schools.  In 2015 there were c.3,250 Brothers and c.70,000 lay people/teachers associated with the Marist congregation, as well as c.655,000 children. This window was added to the school Chapel in 2003, funded by a donation, specifically marked for a further Champagnat window. </p>

    text: "1840, Official portrait of Champagnat by A.V.Ravery, that hangs in the Marist Superior’s Chapel in Rome.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Ravery’s portrait (20 x 60 cm) is a likeness of Champagnat, since it was painted immediately after Champagnat’s death from cancer on 6th June 1840 (celebrated as Champagnat Day by the Marist communities). Ravery, who had painted several paintings for the Chapel at L’Hermitage, was called to paint the deceased, who had been washed, dressed in his cassock, stole and surplice, and placed with his profession Cross in his right hand on a sofa in his room. Champagnat, who died well before photography was widely accessible and was not painted in life, considered (as many religious people did previously) that sitting for a portrait was a demonstration of pride or of unnecessary luxury, and as such something to be avoided.  All later portraits and representations of Champagnat, including Ridolfi’s and Goyo’s (see the next slides), are artistic interpretations of this painting, and attempt to portray something of the spiritual legacy that Champagnat created. </p>

    text: "A representation of Tito Ridolfi’s portrait of Marcellin Champagnat that hangs in the Marist Provincial House at Sacred Heart College. ",
    furtherText: `
    <p>The Beatification of Champagnat was proclaimed by Pope Pius XII on 29 May 1955; from then Champagnat was afforded the title of the &#39;Blessed&#39; Marcellin Champagnat. Artist Tito Ridolfi was commissioned to paint an official portrait of Champagnat for this event, but he lost his sight during work on the piece and as it was unfinished, the portrait was never officially released by the Marist Brothers. The Provincial House portrait is very similar to Ridolfi’s portrait, bar the positioning of Champagnat’s hands and the lighter overall colourings used. In the Chapel, a portrait painted in 1948 by Br Dominguez Garcia at Sacred Heart, combines the hand positioning of Ridolfi’s portrait with the lighter colourings seen in this painting. To celebrate the 1955 event, pupils from Sacred Heart (both Koch Street and Observatory) and from St David’s attended a special Pontifical Mass at City Hall. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>In 1999, Goyo painted this portrait in acrylic on a wood panel measuring 70 x 50cm. Goyo was a Marist pupil from the age of 10, and a later a Brother in Spain. Though he left the institution, he has kept close relations with the Marists. Many of his other paintings that feature Champagnat hang in Marist schools in Spain, and he remains a part of the Marist family in faith and friendship. In the late 1990s, Goyo was asked to create a new portrait of Champagnat to be used for the Canonisation of St Marcellin in 1999. Canonisation changed Champagnat’s appellation, and level of recognition by the Vatican, to Saint Marcellin Champagnat. A large version of Goyo&#39;s portrait, printed on canvas, was displayed in St Peter’s Basilica, Rome, when Champagnat was canonised in 1999. A print of this portrait can be found, amongst other places around the school, hanging in the main school reception hall. </p>

    text: "One of only two original Chalices given to Marcellin Champagnat during his life. ",
    furtherText: `
    <p>The Chalice of Marcellin Champagnat is gold and silver plated and measures c. 15 x 30 cms.  It is boxed in its original casing along with Champagnat’s patten and engraved with “Calice du Vénérable Père Champagnac [sic]” at the base. Translated: ‘Chalice of the Venerable Father Champagnat’. Champagnat’s Chalice was brought to South Africa by Rev Br Justinian from the General House in Italy around the time of Champagnat’s Beatification in 1955. Rev Br Justin, a former Principal of Obs, was Assistant General of the Marist Brothers at the time, and arranged for its transportation in time for the dedication of the Memorial Chapel in 1956. Br Jude (former Provincial) suggests that Br Justinian was granted this request because South Africa was the first country where the Marists established schools in outside of Europe.</p>
<p>This Chalice is mainly used for special occasions at the three Johannesburg Marist schools such as First Holy Communions, Confirmations and at special Masses like those on Champagnat Day in June. On occasion it travels elsewhere in the Province of Southern Africa for similarly significant events. </p>
