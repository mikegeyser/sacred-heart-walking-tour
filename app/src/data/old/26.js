Their black soutanes (robes) with white starched split rectangular collars earnt them the nickname of \u201Ccrows\u201D amongst the boys both at Koch Street and in Observatory.  \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The first official and compulsory uniforms were introduced at the former Marist school in Pietermaritzburg (then Maritzburg) in 1927 by then Principal Br Paul-Camille. This consisted of a blue blazer of with a braid of alternate sections of blue and gold around the edges of the lapel, pockets and cuffs. Br Paul- Camille had been stationed in the early 1900s at the Cala Marist Brothers College in then Tembuland, possibly he took the idea from the blue and gold uniform worn by cadets there at the time. The earliest evidence of the Blue and Gold combination as \u201CMarist\u201D in South Africa is in the 1903 edition of the Marist College Uitenhage magazine called \u201CBlue & Gold\u201D. As the Uitenhage college was the fifth Marist school to open in South Africa, it is likely that these colours had already been adopted at the earlier schools in Cape Town and Port Elizabeth but no documentation exists to confirm this. Br Paul-Camille became Principal at Sacred Heart (Observatory) in 1935.  \n    </p>\n    ",

The striped blazer came in after a 1933 resolution by the Provincial council of South African Marists decreed the following:\n        <blockquote>\n        \u201Cthe uniform of all Marist schools in the country must include a light navy-blue blazer of Venetian cloth with pairs of gold-yellow stripes an eighth inch wide and an eight inch apart, at a distance of 1 \u00BD inch between each pair\u201D\n        </blockquote>  \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The Marist Centenary Digest magazine (1967) surmises this about the blue and gold combination:\n        <blockquote>\n        \u201CSome claim that the colours were brought to South Africa from St Joseph\u2019s College at Dumfries in Scotland. Others say that the blue was chosen for Marist (blue for Our Lady) and the gold from the white and gold of the Papal colours\u2026 that blue is the colour of the heavens which bids us cherish the highest ideals; and that gold represents the sterling qualities of character which the Brothers endeavour to instil in their pupils.\u201D\n        </blockquote>\n    </p>\n    ",

The monogram consists of the letters A and M intertwined representing the Marist\u2019s motto Ad Jesum per Mariam (To Jesus through the way of Mary). AM as a Catholic monogram (usually standing for Ave Maria \u2013 praise/hail Mary) is not unique to the Marist Brothers but AM in this distinctive yellow and blue script is internationally associated with the Marist Congregation.

The reason for the addition of the green and red is not clear but demonstrate the two other colours of the school houses (not represented by the blue and gold already in the crest).

    furtherText: "\n    <p>\n    This badge was designed by Sister Mara O.S.U who was Deputy Principal of the Junior Primary school at the time and was a combination of symbols from the three schools that joined together in 1980. These three schools were Sacred Heart College Observatory, Holy Family Convent, Yeoville and St. Angela\u2019s Convent, Bezuidenhout. For Sacred Heart College (or Marist Obs) the AM monongram is preserved in the badge. The Holy Family Convent, Yeoville (which continued to house the Sacred Heart nursery school until the 1990s) shamrock representing the Holy Family (Jesus, Mary and Joseph) is found in the bottom right. The seven stars in the Ursuline badge (for St Angela\u2019s Convent was run by the Ursuline Order) are arranged in the constellation of Ursula Minor. In this badge the seven stars are rearranged and attached to the cross, the symbol of Christianity, which bound all three schools together. The cross was represented with a crook at the top. A crook is used by both Bishops and shepherds - for both of these figures is a tool that speaks to the care and management of a flock. \n    </p>\n    ",

    text: "The current blazer and school badge, created in 1985, by Kobus Esterhuzien. ",
    furtherText: "\n    <p>\n    In 1986 the school proposed a two section high school with either Afrikaans or English offered as the medium of instruction (rather than only English). In addition, Sotho, French, Portuguese and Italian were offered as second languages. Though the whole school (Nursery, Primary and High School) was to retain the name Sacred Heart College, the High School was renamed Observatory College/Kollege. Both instruction medium groups were combined for sporting and cultural activities but split for Languages, Mathematics, Physical and Social Sciences. This dual first language programme lasted only a couple of years. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The badge created in 1985 was created to launch the above mentioned initiative, but has lasted for at least thirty years longer than the initial reason for its design. The cross with crook has been set within a Huguenot cross to signify the union of both the Catholic and Reformed theological traditions within the mediums of instruction to be offered. The \uF041 and \uF057 , the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet (alpha and omega) used together traditionally signify wholeness and were incorporated to symbolize the diverse (religious, racial and cultural) and co-educational nature of the school. The hearts in the center are the three petals of the Holy Family shamrock and a fourth for the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The stars (though here only five can be seen, with the idea that the other two are artistically \u2018hidden\u2019 behind the logo) are the seven of the constellation Ursula Minor (or little bear) from the Ursuline badge which points to the Pole star, traditionally the star towards which one looks to for direction. As such, the badge speaks to more than just the dual language programme that it was created to around but commemorates the union of three schools and celebrates the diverse and inclusive nature of the Sacred Heart College community. \n    </p>\n    ",
