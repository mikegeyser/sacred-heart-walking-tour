Indeed, quite a crowd is shown in this photograph taken at the opening ceremony. Dalrymple, a Randlord, was likely asked to open the pool whilst acting as Chairman of the Council of the University of the Witwatersrand at the time the pool opened. Dalrymple and his wife, Lady Isobel, were also famed for their hospitality and for having one first privately owned swimming pools at their home in Westcliff. It isn\u2019t recorded in Brother Jordan\u2019s history if there was a further connection around a passion for swimming. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The view, towards the structure at the back of the pool, is towards the eastern perimeter of the school grounds.

Joffe, a school boy here in the 1940s, wrote in his memoires about slipping unnoticed over the school walls and climbing into the locked pool area with school friends for illicit midnight swims (Joffe 2013:68). In the 1962 Maristonian a boy recounted the tale of a tail in the pool. Another boy, as a prank, had let loose his pet snake in the pool. Thankfully it was retrieved the same day. In the 1980s synchronized swimming was offered as a school sport and today the swimming team still participate in the Midmar Mile, as they have done since the late 1980s.  \n    </p>\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>\n    Tiered seating was added to accommodate over 1,200 spectators. The gate entrance (obscured by the tree in this image) was kept from the original 1930 structure. An L-shaped design was selected for the \u2018new\u2019 pool to incorporate the old imperial measure of 25 yards along one \u2018arm\u2019 of the L and a measure of 25 meters along the other \u2018arm\u2019. Both arms were 15 yards wide. The metric side runs north-to-south and was included to conform to the requirements of Olympic distances. Just a few years before the refurbishment, in 1956, Tony Briscoe (matric 1955) swam for South Africa at the Olympics in Melbourne.  \n    </p>\n    ",

A mosaic was added to the bottom of the pool depicting the logo of the Sacred Heart Dolphins, the school swimming team.   \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The Inter House Galas (both for High School and Junior) remain one of the most looked forward to annual events for learners \u2013 house chants are sung, teams are cheered and costumes are worn. Over time have swimming costumes changed from non-uniform, to red for everyone (not only Valerian House) during the 1980s/1990s and today they are Marist blue and gold topped with house-colour swimming caps. Since the Koch street days, swimming galas were always (as were athletics) accompanied by a fancy dress parade or at the very least outfits themed by house or grade and this dressing up continues, some years more participated in than others, as a tradition today. The same silver plated trophies are awarded today to the winning houses that were used in the 1930s, year by year the winning house names are added to the engraving around the cup. These trophies, are kept with other school awards, in a specially designed cabinet under the watchful eye of Memory who runs the Coffee Shop. \n    </p>\n    ",
