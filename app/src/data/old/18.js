L. Keenor, the architect who had planned the wing added in 1931, designed a two-storey block of twelve classrooms with an exterior that matched the already established College buildings. He was careful to provide in his plans for the latest improvements in acoustics and comfort.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    In addition to the twelve classroom block built under Mr. A Bennett in 1935, a games-room, extra lodgings for the support staff together with a bicycle shed with racks for some 170 bicycles, were constructed by Mr. J. E. Morren.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Two days before the re-opening of the College, which took place that year on the 28th January, the new buildings were blessed by His Excellency the Rt. Rev. Bishop O'Leary, O.M.I, and dedicated to the Christian education of youth. He was assisted in ceremony by Rev. Fathers E. Roux, O.M.I., and Abramo, O.M.I, of Yeoville and Kerk Street parishes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    (text adapted from the 1935 Maristonian p55)\n    </p>\n    ",
