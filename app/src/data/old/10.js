    furtherText: "\n    <p>\n    Mary is traditionally represented wearing blue. Blue dye (ultramarine, made from crushed semi-precious stone lapis lazuli) was a very rare commodity in ancient times and as such was associated with royalty and the wealthy and as such in religious pictures, a heavenly grace bestowed on the worthy. Some sources suggest that in the middle east, where Mary came from, blue clothing was associated with virginity. Blue is the colour of the sky and heavens in Catholic tradition and from where Jesus\u2019s heavenly arrival was proclaimed. Mary\u2019s cloak is edged with gold. Again, this colour refers to royalty and Mary is held to be the \u201CQueen of Heaven\u201D.  Of course, blue and gold are the two colours chosen for the uniform of Sacred Heart College (and the other Marist schools in South Africa). \n    </p>    \n    ",

It was before the black virgin, in the Chapel of Our Lady of Fouvi\u00E8re, that Champagnat and other newly ordained priests pledged to establish the Society of Mary in 1816. For Champagnat, Mary as mother \u2013 loving, faithful, giving and guiding - was the ultimate role model and it is from the relationship of Mary to Jesus that Marist principles are derived. In turn, the ethos of Sacred Heart College is based on this. \n    </p>\n    ",
