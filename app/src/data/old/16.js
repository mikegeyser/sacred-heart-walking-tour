    furtherText: "\n    <p>\n    Champagnat\u2019s experience with the Montagne boy confirmed his calling to teach the children in the rural areas of his parish. Within a few months of the boy\u2019s death Champagnat had found two men willing to train as teachers and to follow in the way of Mary \u2013 with them Champagnat, curate the village of La Valla, started a school and a foundation house (part monastery and part teacher training college) for the newly founded congregation of Marist Brothers on 2 January 1817. The original foundation house soon became too small and Notre Dame de L\u2019Hermitage (depicted in bottom right of window as a red roofed building) was built in 1825 to accommodate 100 Brothers.     \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    This window was gifted to the school chapel on the occasion of then pupil, Ricardo Louriero\u2019s, First Holy Communion (1998) in 2000 by his family. Also of interest is the Champagnat signature copied from Champagnat\u2019s own handwritten letters. The violets \u2013 a tiny but strongly fragrant flower - symbolise the three quiet virtues espoused by the Marist tradition, humility, simplicity, and modesty. The three nails allude not only to the crucifixion but also to the trade plied by the Marist Brothers in their early days, that of making nails. The largest nearby town, St Etienne, was (and remains) a center for metalwork.\n    </p>\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>\n    This window was added to the school chapel in 2003 funded by a donation, specifically marked for a further Champagnat window. Champagnat envisioned a brotherhood to tend to the educational and spiritual needs of children.    \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Champagnat outlined his intentions:\n    <blockquote>\n    Ordained a priest in 1816, I was assigned to a town in the district of St.-Chamond (Loire). What I saw with my own eyes in that new post, with reference to the education, reminded me of the difficulties I had experienced myself at their age, for lack of teachers.\n    <footer>Champagnat to Queen Marie-Am\u00E9lie, Letters, 59</footer>\n    </blockquote>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Champagnat first employed a lay teacher at La Valla to support his teaching whilst he trained the two first brothers. By the time of his death in 1840, only 23 years after the founding of the Marist Brothers, there were 278 Brothers in 48 schools.  In 2015 there were c.3,250 Brothers and c.70,000 lay people/teachers associated with the Marist congregation, as well as c.655,000 children.\n     </p>\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>\n    The Beatification of Champagnat was proclaimed by Pope Pius XII on 29 May 1955 \u2013 from then Champagnat was afforded the title of the Venerable (or Blessed) Champagnat. Artist Tito Ridolfi was commissioned to paint an official portrait of Champagnat for this event, but he lost his sight during work on the piece and as it was unfinished, the portrait was never officially released by the Marist Brothers. The Provincial House portrait is very similar to Ridolfi\u2019s portrait, bar the positioning of Champagnat\u2019s hands and the lighter overall colourings used. In the chapel, a portrait painted by Br Dominguez Garcia in 1948 at Sacred Heart, combines the hand positioning of Ridolfi\u2019s portrait with the lighter colourings seen in this painting. To celebrate the 1955 event, pupils from Sacred Heart (both Koch Street and Observatory) and from St David\u2019s attended a special Pontifical Mass at City Hall.     \n    </p>\n    ",

Ravery, who had painted several paintings for the chapel at L\u2019Hermitage, was called to paint the deceased who had been washed, dressed in his cassock, stole and surplice and placed with his profession cross in his right hand on a sofa in his room.    \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Marcellin Champagnat was not painted in life, and well before the advent of photography which made visual memorials more widely accessible, considered (as many religious people did previously) that sitting for a portrait was a demonstration of pride or of unnecessary luxury and therefore something to be avoided.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    All later portraits and representations of Champagnat, including Ridolfi\u2019s and Goyo\u2019s (the latter was commissioned specially for the Canonisation in 1999) are artistic interpretations of this painting and as such attempt to portray something of the spiritual legacy that Champagnat created. \n    </p>\n    ",

Rev Br Justin, a former Principal of Obs who at the time was Assistant General of the Marist Brothers arranged for its transportation in time for the dedication of the Memorial Chapel in 1956 and is kept by the Marist Brothers under lock and key.
