The Koch Street boys played their sports at these grounds as there were no school playing fields – the dirt and tarmac playground did not provide adequate space for matches. This picture shows what would have been either an after-match tea for either athletics, soccer, or cricket (the school sports) or following a display by the Cadets or the Gymnasts.",

    <p>Lunch hour games and sports were held at the Union Grounds (situated south of the railway track, a few blocks away from the school) with matches and displays held at the Wanderers Grounds (north of the railway and also a few blocks away from the school). The Old Wanderers Grounds is not to be confused with the new Wanderers grounds in Illovo, purchased in the 1930s but only occupied in the late 1940s when the Doornfontein location near Koch Street was sold to the South African Railways Corporation for the extension of Park Station. </p>

    <p>Until the Brothers’ Residence was constructed in the mid-1980s, the Brothers resided in rooms upstairs in the main building. Today these are the offices and staff room between the top of the foyer staircase and the Old Chapel Theatre. The Brothers had their own Dining Room so that they could eat separately from the Boarders (until the mid 1970s, when boarding was phased out) and retire together from daily school life. After sports matches on a Saturday the Brothers invited staff (and visiting staff) to have tea in their dining room.</p>

    text: "2017, the interior of Habits Coffee Shop. Habits, was so named to reference the former use of the room as the Brothers' Dining Room (a nod to the distinctive clothing worn by the Marist Brothers) and to connect with the current Coffee Shop ‘feeding one’s caffeine habit’.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Religious Orders’ distinctive tunic style clothing, habits or soutanes, are worn as an outward sign of spiritual pledges and of their modest lifestyles. The soutanes worn by the Marist Brothers in South Africa are made of a lightweight white fabric, rather than the traditional heavier black version, following dispensation from the General House that it be worn in countries with a hot climate. The soutane was worn with a white rabat (a long rectangular collar) but today the Brothers rather wear a clerical shirt and white banded collar. For the Marists, the rabat signifies their teaching mission. The black cord worn around their waists symbolises being ‘bound’ to God, demonstrating that the Brother has made his first profession (promise) with the Marists. A Brother who wears a crucifix pinned to the front of his soutane demonstrates that he has made his final profession to the Order. Today the soutane is largely kept for formal and religious occasions and the Brothers generally just wear a crucifix or simple Marist cross over a shirt or jersey.</p>
<p>The table and chairs are those used by the Brothers in their Dining Room, restored and repainted for use in the Coffee Shop by Joseph Letebele of the Workshop. He also made the Trophy Cabinet visible at the back of this image. </p>

    <p>Memory Mpharu is a mother figure to many a learner, staff member and parent as she welcomes them to the Coffee Shop which is open from 7 until 4 daily. Sweet baked treats (made by the parent of a former learner) are on offer to go with Memory’s selection of hot drinks served with personalised words of wisdom such as ‘be yourself my darling’. Each sale in Habits contributes towards the College’s Field of Flowers Bursary Scheme. Memory co-ordinates a number of other projects, such as the sale of second hand text books and assists the PA with organising their events. </p>
