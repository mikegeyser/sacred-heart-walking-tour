Sports were played there by the Koch Street boys as there were no school playing fields – the dirt and tarmac playground was insufficient space to play matches. This picture shows what would have been either an after-match tea for either athletics, soccer, or cricket (the school sports) or following a display by the Cadets or the Gymnasts.",

    <p>Lunch hour games and sports were held at the Union Grounds (situated south of the railway track, a few blocks away from the school) with matches and displays being held at the Wanderers Grounds (north of the railway and also a few blocks away from the school). The Old Wanderers Grounds is not to be confused with the Wanderers (new) grounds situated in Illovo – these were purchased by Wanderers Club in the 1930s but the club only moved from the Doorfontein location near Koch Street in the late 1940s when the Old Wanderers grounds were purchased for use by the South African Railways Corporation to extend Park Station’s infrastructure. </p>

    <p>Until the Brothers’ Residence was constructed in the mid 1980s the Brothers’ resided in rooms upstairs in the main building (today these are the offices and staff room between the top of the foyer staircase and the Old Chapel Theatre). As such, the Brothers had their own Dining Room in which to eat separately from the Boarders (until the mid 1970s when boarding was phased out) and to retire together from daily school life (until the construction of the Brothers&#39; Residence). After sports matches on a Saturday the Brothers invited staff (and visiting staff) to have tea in their dining room. </p>

    text: "2017, the interior of Habits Coffee Shop. Habits, was so named to reference the former use of the room as the Brother’s Dining Room (a nod to the distinctive clothing worn by the Marist Brothers) and to connect with the current Coffee Shop ‘feeding one’s caffeine habit’.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Religious Orders’ distinctive tunic style clothing, habits or soutanes, are worn as an outward sign of spiritual pledges and of their modest lifestyles. The soutanes worn by the Marist Brothers in South Africa are made of a lightweight white fabric, rather than the traditional heavier black version, after a dispensation from the General House allowing this to be worn in countries with a hot climate. The soutane was worn with a white rabat (a long rectangular collar) but today the Brothers rather wear a clerical shirt with a white banded collar. The rabat is a signifier of a profession; for the Marists this signified their teaching mission. The black cord worn around the Brothers’ waists symbolizes being ‘bound’ to God and demonstrates that the Brother has made his first profession (promise) to join the Marists. A Brother who wears a crucifix pinned to the front of his soutane demonstrates that he has made his final profession to the Order. Today in South Africa the Brothers more often than not wear attire other than the soutane which is kept for formal and religious occasions, perhaps just wearing a crucifix or simple Marist cross over a shirt or jersey. </p>
<p>The table and chairs in Habits were original to the Brothers’ Dining Room, restored and repainted for use in the Coffee Shop by the Workshop’s Joseph Letebele. The Trophy Cabinet visible in this image was also made by him. </p>

    <p>Memory Mpharu is a mother figure to many a learner, staff member and parent as she welcomes them to the Coffee Shop which is open from 7 until 4 daily. Sweet baked treats are on offer (made by the parent of a former learner) to go with Memory’s selection of hot drinks served with personalised words of wisdom such as ‘be yourself my darling’. Each sale in Habits contributes towards the College’s Field of Flowers Bursary Scheme. Memory co-ordinates a number of other projects such as the sale of second hand text books and assists the PA with organizing their events. </p>
