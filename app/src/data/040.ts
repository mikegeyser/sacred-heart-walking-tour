Sports were played there by the Koch Street boys as there were no school playing fields – the dirt and tarmac playground was insufficient space to play matches. This picture shows what would have been either an after-match tea for either athletics, soccer, or cricket (the school sports) or following a display by the Cadets or the Gymnasts.",

    <p>Lunch hour games and sports were held at the Union Grounds (situated south of the railway track, a few blocks away from the school) with matches and displays being held at the Wanderers Grounds (north of the railway and also a few blocks away from the school). The Old Wanderers Grounds is not to be confused with the Wanderers (new) grounds situated in Illovo – these were purchased by Wanderers Club in the 1930s but the club only moved from the Doorfontein location near Koch Street in the late 1940s when the Old Wanderers grounds were purchased for use by the South African Railways Corporation to extend Park Station’s infrastructure. </p>

    <p>Until the Brothers’ Residence was constructed in the mid 1980s the Brothers’ resided in rooms upstairs in the main building (today these are the offices and staff room between the top of the foyer staircase and the Old Chapel Theatre). As such they had their own Dining Room in which to eat and retire separately from the Boarders (until the mid 1970s when boarding was phased out) and from the rest of daily school life (until the 1980s). </p>

Each sale in Habits contributes towards the College’s Field of Flowers Bursary Scheme. ",
