    furtherText: `
    <p>There are six flags; one each for the four School Houses at Koch Street, a flag for the Marist Brothers’ College (third from right) and one with an obscured symbol, possibly the Sacred Heart (far right).  Though the image is in black and white, one can just about make out the hues of the colours of the four School Houses; the colours still used today. Each flag has a single letter denoting the house; <strong>F</strong>rederick (in green, far left), <strong>G</strong>eddes (in blue, second left), <strong>V</strong>alerian (in red, third left) and <strong>O</strong>’Leary (in yellow, second from right). At Observatory, Frederick House was replaced by Benedict House.</p>
<p>The Marist Brothers flag shows the letters A and M intertwined, a monogram representing their motto Ad Jesum per Mariam (To Jesus through the way of Mary). AM as a Catholic monogram (standing for Ave Maria – praise/hail Mary) is not unique to the Marist Brothers but, in the distinctive gold and blue script is internationally associated with the Marist Congregation. Under the monogram is a scroll with the letters M.B.C. (Marist Brothers College), with the letters JHB for Johannesburg underneath. The sixth flag is not clearly identifiable. It might feature the Sacred Heart emblem, first flown above the Koch Street school within the French flag, hoisted by Br Frederick to demonstrate the neutrality of the hospital-cum-school during the second South African War in 1900. Another possibility is that it showed the logo of the Old Boys Association as these flags were presented by the Old Boys’ Association. Second from right is W. Singleton, Koch Street alumnus, and later teacher and librarian. All learners at the school are divided amongst the four houses. Siblings are allocated the same houses.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>These enamel and metal badges (c. 1.5 x 2 cm) were worn on the blazer’s left hand lapel. Pictures in the Maristonian show learners wearing these between the years of c.1928-1942. Post WW2, when finances were tight, the badges were phased out, though they were reintroduced for a period of time between the 1950s and ‘70s. This collection was donated to Museum Africa in 1951. </p>
<p>The Marist AM monogram is centred in the badge, with the house name written in the scroll below the monogram. The coloured background is specific to each house. Above the monogram is a single star; alluding to Mary, the Marist’s guiding star like the star of Bethlehem for the Magi (in Biblical texts). The “J” below the monogram signifies either Johannesburg or Junior Marist (categorised as pupils in standards 1 to 5, equivalent of grades 2-6 today). It is most likely Johannesburg as, prior to 1933 (when the Brothers’ Council first allowed the different Marist schools in South Africa to wear different blazers), Marist uniforms between schools were distinguished only by a metal badge, similar to the above, with a letter denoting the school, for example: MBR for Marist Brothers Rondebosch and MBD for Marist Brothers Durban. </p>

    text: "1955, Boys from Marist schools at the Beatification Mass of Marcellin Champagnat in Johannesburg City Hall.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Benedict House is named for the Founder of the Marist Brothers, Marcellin Joseph Benedict Champagnat. Marcellin Champagnat was born in France in 1789 during a time of economic, spiritual and cultural unrest (the time of the French Revolution and its aftermath) and on becoming a priest, dedicated his life’s mission to the foundation of a teaching brotherhood. Marist Brothers first arrived in South Africa in 1967 and established several schools, inspired by the example of their founder, Champagnat. 2017 marks the 150th anniversary of the Brothers’ arrival on the African continent and 200 years since the Marist Brothers started their mission. Champagnat was venerated by the Pope in 1955 and boys from both Sacred Heart Colleges (in Koch Street and at Observatory) and from St.David’s College, Inanda attended a special Mass held at City Hall to honour this. </p>
<p>Shortly before the College opened in Observatory, the Chapel was dedicated to St. Benedict by Bishop O&#39;Leary. The College was most likely first named St. Benedict&#39;s, to differentiate it from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street. The name Sacred Heart College was only officialised by the 1930s, though Marist Brothers Observatory (or ‘Obs’) was used colloquially until the 1980s. This might explain why the green house is called Benedict, and not Marcellin or Champagnat. Benedict House is the only house that didn’t exist at Koch Street; it replaced Frederick House (Br Frederick was the first Principal). </p>

    text: "Mr Joe Geddes (far right) with learners at Koch Street in 1896.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Mr Joe Geddes, after whom the blue house is named, was one of the first pupils to start at Koch Street in 1889, having arrived in Johannesburg with his father, a miner. Geddes became a student teacher in the early 1890s, after just a few years at school, and stayed as a permanent teacher on completion of his training. According to material in the Marist Archive, Geddes lost his right hand in his youth but was reputed to have the best handwriting in the school. He was, according to the 75th Anniversary Maristonian (1964), a ‘landmark at the school’. His brother, Robert Geddes, also a Koch Street pupil, wrote in the 1926 Maristonian about Joe Geddes’ fervour for soccer, bowls and cricket and remembered how, at a young age, Joe narrowly escaped being attacked by a snake whilst on a trek. Robert Geddes wrote that his brother – a great character builder – should be remembered for embodying his life motto: ‘everything worth doing, is worth doing well’. Joe Geddes died in 1923. </p>
<p>Though Joe Geddes was the first Sacred Heart alumni to become part of the teaching staff, he certainly wasn’t the last. Current alumni, now staff, include Mrs King (née Krause) and Mrs McCreesh (née Niken). </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>O’Leary House, the yellow house, is named after the Rt. Rev David O’Leary, Bishop (or Vicar Apostolic of the Transvaal) of the then Transvaal at the time that the school was opened in Observatory; he blessed the College Chapel and officiated at the opening ceremony for the new school. O.M.I denotes his membership of the The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, another Catholic congregation founded in 1816 by Eugene de Mazenod, a contemporary of Marcellin Champagnat. O’Leary, born in Kimberley in 1880, attended the Marist Brothers’ College in Uitenhage. During WW1, O’Leary served as military Chaplain to the Allied Forces in East Africa. O’Leary enjoyed soccer and played cricket for the Marist Old Boys’ team. He was the first South African to join the Episcopacy (the Church government) and was honoured by the Vatican with the positions of Papal Count and Assistant to the Pontifical Throne.</p>
<p>O’Leary died in 1958. The Maristonian noted, “St. David’s College, Inanda, which has been named after him and O’Leary House at Observatory will help to keep ever green the memory of a great friend and counsellor.” </p>

    text: "Bust of Brother Valerian kept in the Marist Archive.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>The 75th Anniversary issue of the Maristonian said that “the energy of Brother Valerian underlies every phase of the early history of the school”. Br Valerian, for whom the red house is named, arrived at Koch Street in 1890. The Valerian Prize, also named for him, is awarded for academic excellence to a Junior Matric (grade 11 today). Br Valerian, who was not being able to “disassociate purely scholastic work from physical training”, taught the senior classes as well as gym, athletics and the Cadets. He once took his class to hear the first phonograph in Johannesburg, at the time a huge novelty, and produced the first Maristonian in 1908. </p>
<p>In 1894, only three pupils in the then Transvaal Republic, all Marist learners, were sitting Matric. Br Valerian supervised the boys’ examinations in Bloemfontein. An illuminated manuscript of thanks to Br Valerian from their parents is kept in the Marist archive. Morris Alexander, one of the first pupils in 1889, writing in the 1941 Maristonian, credits Br Valerian for his valuable assistance in getting him through his matric in 1900. In that year the exam papers were brought by military escort from Cape Town. This bust was presented by Old Boys in 1916 as a token of gratitude, dedicated to the memory of Br Valerian, who died in 1914.</p>
