    text: "1939, Old Boys present School and House flags at Koch Street.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Here there are six flags; one each for the four school houses at Koch Street, a flag for the Marist Brothers’ College (third from right) and one with an obscured symbol, possibly the Sacred Heart (far right).  Though the image is in black and white, one can just about make out the hues of the colours of the four school houses; the colours still used today. Each flag has a single letter denoting the house; <strong>F</strong>rederick (in green, far left), <strong>G</strong>eddes (in blue, second left), <strong>V</strong>alerian (in red, third left) and <strong>O</strong>’Leary (in yellow, second from right). At Observatory, Frederick House was replaced by Benedict House.</p>
<p>The Marist Brothers flag shows the letters A and M intertwined, a monogram representing their motto Ad Jesum per Mariam (To Jesus through the way of Mary). AM as a Catholic monogram (standing for Ave Maria – praise/hail Mary) is not unique to the Marist Brothers but, in the distinctive gold and blue script is internationally associated with the Marist Congregation. Under the monogram is a scroll with the letters M.B.C. (Marist Brothers College), with the letters JHB for Johannesburg underneath. The sixth flag is not clearly identifiable. It might feature the Sacred Heart emblem, first flown above the Koch Street school within the French flag, hoisted by Br Frederick to demonstrate the neutrality of the hospital-cum-school during the second South African War in 1900. Another possibility is that it showed the logo of the Old Boys Association as these flags were presented by the Old Boys’ Association. </p>
<p>Second from right is W. Singleton, Koch Street alumnus, then teacher at Observatory and later librarian when the purpose-built library was added to the College in 1961. Learners at the school, from Pre-Primary to Matric, are divided amongst the four school houses. Siblings are allocated the same houses. The house system is most visible during sports events. At these, and at other house associated events, the learners wear their assigned house coloured t-shirts. </p>

    text: "Badges worn in learners’ lapels before WW2 to denote their house. ",
    furtherText: `
    <p>These enamel and metal badges (measuring approx. 1.5 x 2 cm) were worn in the left hand lapel. Pictures can be found in the Maristonian of learners wearing these badges between the years of c.1928-1942. It is likely that post World War Two, when finances were tight, that these were phased out for this reason. This collection of badges was donated to Museum Africa in 1951. </p>
<p>The Marist AM monogram is centred in the badge, with the house name written in the scroll below the monogram. The coloured background is specific to each house. Above the monogram is a single star; alluding to Mary, the Marist’s guiding star like as the star of Bethlehem for the Magi (in Biblical texts) and referring to the single star in the House of David’s crest to which Jesus’ ancestry is ascribed. The “J” below the monogram signifies either Johannesburg or Junior Marist (categorised as pupils in standards 1 to 5, equivalent of grades 2-6 today). It is most likely Johannesburg as, prior to 1933 (when the Brother’s Council’s resolution allowed for non-standardisation of Marist blazers amongst the South African schools), Marist uniforms between schools were distinguished by a metal badge, similar to the above, with a slight change in lettering to denote the school. For example, MBR for Marist Brothers Rondebosch and MBD for Marist Brothers Durban. </p>

    text: "Portrait of St Marcellin Benedict Champagnat by Gregorio (Goyo) Dominguez, 1999.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Benedict House is named for the Founder of the Marist Brothers, Marcellin Joseph Benedict Champagnat. Shortly before the College opened, the Chapel was dedicated by Bishop O&#39;Leary to St. Benedict and documents in the Marist Archive suggest that the College originally opened as St. Benedict&#39;s to differentiate from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street. The name Sacred Heart College was only officialised by the 1930s, though Marist Brothers Observatory (or ‘Obs’) was used colloquially until the 1980s. This might explain why the house is called Benedict and not Marcellin or Champagnat. Benedict House is the only house which didn’t exist at Koch Street; it replaced Frederick House (Br Frederick was the first Principal). </p>
<p>Goyo painted this portrait in acrylic on a wood panel measuring 70 x 50cm in 1999. Goyo was a Marist pupil in Spain from the age of 10 and a Brother in his twenties. Though he left the Institution he kept very close relations with his Marist family and in the late 1990s was asked to create a new portrait of Champagnat to be used for the Canonisation of St Marcellin. A large version of this portrait printed on canvas was displayed in St Peter’s Basilica, Rome when Champagnat was canonised in 1999. A print of this portrait can be found, amongst other places around the school, hanging in the main school reception hall. </p>

    text: "Mr Joe Geddes (far right) with learners at Koch Street in 1896.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Mr Joe Geddes, after whom one of the houses is named, was one of the first pupils to start at Koch Street in 1889 having arrived with his father, who came to mine, in Johannesburg the year before. Geddes became a student teacher in the early 1890s, after just a few years at school, and stayed as a permanent teacher on completion of his training. According to material in the Marist Archive, Geddes lost his right hand in his youth but was reputed to have the best handwriting in the school. He was, according to the 75th Anniversary Maristonian (1964), a ‘landmark at the school’. His brother, Robert Geddes, also a Koch Street pupil, wrote in the 1926 Maristonian about Joe Geddes’ fervour for soccer, bowls and cricket and remembered how, at a young age, Joe narrowly escaped being attacked by a snake whilst on a trek. Robert Geddes wrote that his brother - a great character builder - should be remembered for embodying his life motto ‘everything worth doing, is worth doing well’. Joe Geddes died in 1923.</p>
<p>Though Joe Geddes was the first Sacred Heart alumni to become part of the teaching staff, he certainly wasn’t the last. Current alumni now staff include Ms King (primary) and Ms Niken (high school).</p>

    text: "Bishop David O’Leary O.M.I at his consecration in 1925.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>O’Leary House is named after the Rt. Rev David O’Leary, Bishop (or Vicar Apostolic of the Transvaal Vicariate) of the then Transvaal at the time that the school was opened in Observatory; he blessed the college chapel and officiated at the opening ceremony for the new school. O.M.I denotes his membership of the The Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, another Catholic congregation founded by Eugene de Mazenod in 1816, a contemporary of Marcellin Champagnat. O’Leary was born in Kimberley in 1880 and attended the Marist Brothers’ College in Uitenhage. During the first world war, O’Leary served as military chaplain to the Allied Forces in East Africa. O’Leary was an active ‘Old Boy’ for the Marists – he played cricket for their teams and also is reported to have enjoyed soccer. O’Leary was the first South African to form part of the Episcopacy (the Church government) and was honoured by the Vatican with the positions of Papal Count and Assistant to the Pontifical Throne. </p>
<p>In the 1958 Maristonian, published in the year of his death, notes that “St. David’s College, Inanda, which has been named after him and O’Leary House at Observatory will help to keep ever green the memory of a great friend and counsellor.” </p>

    text: "Bust of Brother Valerian kept in the Marist Archive.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Valerian (1865-1914) arrived in South Africa in 1889 from Ireland and went first to the Marist’s school at Uitenhage in 1890 and then to Koch Street in the same year. The 75th Anniversary issue of the Maristonian notes that “the energy of Brother Valerian underlies every phase of the early history of the school’. The Valerian Prize, awarded for academic excellence to one Junior Matric at Koch Street (the equivalent of grade 10 today). Br Valerian was remembered for not being able to “disassociate purely scholastic work from physical training” and taught the senior classes as well as gym, athletics and the cadets. He once took his class to hear the first phonograph in Johannesburg, at the time a huge novelty and exhibited in the glass roofed Old Arcade, and was responsible for producing the first school magazine in 1908. </p>
<p>In 1894, only three pupils, all Marist learners, in the then Transvaal were sitting Matric. Br Valerian supervised the boys’ transit and examinations in Bloemfontein. An illuminated manuscript of thanks to Br Valerian from the parents of these boys is kept in the Marist archive. Morris Alexander, one of the first pupils in 1889, and writing in the 1941 Maristonian, credits Br Valerian for his valuable assistance in getting him through his matric in 1900. In this year the exam papers were brought by military escort from Cape Town. The bust from which the image is taken was presented by Old Boys in October 1916 as a token of gratitude, was dedicated to the memory of Br Valerian.</p>
