    <p>Usually to be found in The Orchard where the After Care operates, if the weather is bad Uncle Sammy can be found with his ice-cream cart (from which he also sells popcorn, chips and suckers for those not after ice-cream) in one of the quads. </p>
<p>The 2003 Sacred Heart College yearbook captioned a photograph of Ntate Sammy in one of the quads with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> “What would our learners do without Sammy? For over forty years, Sammy has been part of Sacred Heart College. He has always been an honest businessman and goes out of his way to sort out “I’m a few cents short Sammy”.”</p>

    <p>Uncle Sammy has been selling his ice creams at Sacred Heart College for nearly 55 years, a constant in the everyday life of a place that has seen many a transformation. </p>
<p>Until the 1970s Uncle Sammy used to sell his ice cream at the entrance gates to the College, thereafter he came onto the school premises to sell, invited by the then Principal, Brother Neil McGurk, indicating how even then, he had become an integral part of the school community. </p>
<p>Not only does Uncle Sammy form part of tradition at the College for individuals and families but for the whole school community. During this conversation in which Brother Neil McGurk, recollects about Uncle Sammy, he later said of him, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“characters like that make for a place.”</p>
</blockquote>

    <p>Before Uncle Sammy arrives at Sacred Heart, usually at around 2.30 (until after 5pm on a hot day … good for sales!), he stops at the gates of King Edward VII school where he also sells to the boys who attend there.  Therefore, Uncle Sammy is part of the fabric of the wider local community as well as being a familiar figure at Sacred Heart College. A quick scan of the school and alumni Facebook pages confirms this through the many posts and comments that fondly recall his presence (and presents!).</p>
