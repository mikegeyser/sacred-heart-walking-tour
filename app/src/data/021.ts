    <p>In the 1929 Maristonian, Gustavus Hartog (Matric of 1894 – the first year of Matriculants from Koch Street – who later became a politician and retired as a South African Senator) wrote about swimming with his peers from Koch Street in places like Sans Souci (now Parkview) and Orange Grove, where one could still find streams with waterfalls, in the late 1880s/early1890s. Perhaps this photograph was taken at one of those sites. It is also possible that this photograph was taken at the natural pool under the waterfall in Roodepoort (now the Walter Sisulu Botanical Gardens) or in what is now known Emmarentia Dam for the boys also took excursions by horse and cart to these locations. </p>

    <p>The boys from Sacred Heart College, Koch Street, used public swimming baths (built in 1890) in Raleigh Street, Yeoville in the summer, and may have used the private Summit Club in Hillbrow during the winter.</p>
<p>In 1905 an appeal by the then Headmaster, Brother Callixte, was made to parents to consider donating funds to build a swimming pool at Koch Street. This project was never realised.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>On 4th October 1930, Sir William Dalrymple opened the swimming pool. Brother Jordan (Principal in the 1950s) wrote, in a history of the Marists in South Africa up until 1955, of Dalrymple ‘addressing the throng’ at the opening of the school pool. Indeed, quite a crowd is shown in this photograph taken at the opening ceremony. Dalrymple, a Randlord, was likely asked to open the pool whilst acting as Chairman of the Council of the University of the Witwatersrand at that time. Dalrymple and his wife, Lady Isobel, were also famed for their hospitality and for having one first privately owned swimming pools at their home in Westcliff. It isn’t recorded in Brother Jordan’s history if there was a further connection around a passion for swimming.</p>
<p>The view, towards the structure at the back of the pool, is towards the eastern perimeter of the school grounds. The small trees are today lofty pines demarcating the edge of Steyn Street.</p>

    <p>A series of nine postcards – early marketing materials – were produced for the College in the 1940s. This one shows some pool games, likely taking place during a swimming gala. Not all pool activities involve swimming lengths. Edward Joffe, a school boy here in the 1940s, wrote in his memoires how he and his friends would slip unnoticed over the school walls and climb into the locked pool area with school friends for illicit midnight swims (Joffe 2013:68). In the 1962 Maristonian a boy recounted the tale of a tail in the pool. Another boy, as a prank, had let loose his pet snake in the pool. Thankfully it was retrieved the same day. In the 1980s synchronised swimming was offered as a school sport and today the swimming team still participates in the Midmar Mile, as they have done since the late 1980s.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>In 1961 the pool was extended and its surrounds upgraded. Tiered seating was added to accommodate over 1,200 spectators. The gate entrance was kept from the original 1930 structure. An L-shaped design was selected for the ‘new’ pool to incorporate the old imperial measure of 25 yards along one ‘arm’ of the L and a measure of 25 meters along the other ‘arm’. Both arms were 15 yards wide. The metric side runs north-to-south and was included to conform to the requirements of Olympic distances. Just a few years before the refurbishment, in 1956, Tony Briscoe (matric 1955) swam for South Africa at the Olympics in Melbourne. In 1997, the grandstand seating at the northern and eastern ends of the pool was demolished. Renovations to these areas had become necessary. Funded by the Development Fund and the PTA, shade-cloth for the new seating areas and a judge’s box were added, along with a sound-system. A second phase of renovations to the pool area, two years later, included the conversion of an adjacent garage into the College Fitness Centre and the addition of the studio space above.  </p>

    <p>In 2010 the baby pool was added, shades erected over the spectator stands and the starting blocks remodelled. The pool bottom was mosaicked with the school’s sports emblem, the ‘Dolphins’ of Sacred Heart College.</p>
<p>The Inter House Galas remain one of the most looked forward to annual events – house chants are sung, teams are cheered and costumes worn. Over time swimming costumes changed from non-uniform, to red for everyone (not only Valerian House) during the 1980s/1990s, to today’s Marist blue and gold topped with house-colour swimming caps. Since the Koch street days, swimming galas have always been (as has athletics) accompanied by a fancy-dress parade. This dressing up continues, some years more enthusiastically than others, as a tradition today. The same silver plated trophies awarded today were used in the 1930s. Each year winning house names are engraved around the cup. </p>
