    <p>For sometime, the steady increase in the number of students seeking admission into the College had emphasised the need for additional class-rooms and further staff accommodation, so to meet this need, Mr. E. L. Keenor, the architect who had planned the wing added in 1931, designed a two-storey block of twelve classrooms with an exterior that matched the already established College buildings. He was careful to provide in his plans for the latest improvements in acoustics and comfort.</p>
<p>In addition to the twelve classroom block built under Mr. A Bennett in 1935, a gamesroom, extra lodgings for the support staff, and a bicycle shed with racks for some 170 bicycles, were constructed by Mr. J. E. Morren.</p>
<p>Two days before the re-opening of the College, which took place that year on the 28th of January, the new buildings were blessed by His Excellency the Rt. Rev. Bishop O&#39;Leary, O.M.I, and dedicated to the Christian education of youth. He was assisted in the ceremony by Rev. Fathers E. Roux, O.M.I., and Abramo, O.M.I, of Yeoville and Kerk Street parishes.</p>

    <p>The Knights of the Altar was a society established by Brother Otto whilst posted on mission to a Marist school in China in 1938. Their function was, as a group of boys who were responsible for duties assisting Ministers during Mass, “to form a worthy guard of honour of our Divine Eucharistic King”. The Knights of the Altar was first established in South Africa at Obs in 1960 and thereafter in other Marist schools in the Republic. Brother Otto is pictured centre in this image, with D. Ball (Supreme Grand Knight) to his left and P. Abraham (Vice-Supreme Grand Knight) to his right.</p>
