    furtherText: `
    <p>The phonograph was invented by Thomas Edison (also the inventor of the lightbulb) in 1877. It was the first machine on which sound could be recorded and reproduced on a prototype ‘record’. The phonograph evolved to become the gramophone and then the record player –the precursor to cassettes, CDs and downloadable music files. Some DJs however still prefer the sound quality of vinyl or ‘records’ on which to play their sets. The first of these machines arrived in Johannesburg in the 1890s and the Brothers saw to acquire one for the school.</p>
<p>In this picture an early phonograph machine is set on the table with several sets of earphones (though these were more like medical stethoscopes!) attached. The Brothers ran a fundraising scheme for the school with the boys paying three-pence each to listen to the recording – either music or special listings. The Brothers also recorded the names of boys who had attained good results or deserved special mention for particular activities and these names were listed and played during assemblies (for the phonograph could also be played with a horn like attachment which acted as a kind of loudspeaker).</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Teacher Garvin was one of the first music teachers employed at the school, along with Mr Hyde who was responsible for the Brass Band. They were among some of the first lay members of staff, since staff were principally Brothers. Many of the boys learnt instruments as part of early extra–mural activities. Singing was regarded as an important skill and was a compulsory subject for all the boys. To accompany the Cadet Corps there was both a Reed Band (woodwind) and a Brass Band.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Marching Band at Sacred Heart College held a very special position within the school’s history, from the Koch Street days and for many years at Observatory. Starting off as the Marching Band that led Cadet Corps displays, even after the Cadets&#39; dissolution, the band ‘marched on’, leading learners to athletics meetings and swimming galas. It is because of this tradition that a ‘march on’ is still how the school progresses to the top fields to take part in the annual inter-house athletics meeting in September, but now music is played through the loudspeaker system rather than accompanied with an actual band.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>In addition to class music lessons, many learners take extra lessons in instruments or voice, and are part of musical societies at school. Several alumni, like the pictured Vincent Fritelli, who in the 1955 Maristonian was described as a “prodigy of the violin”, have gone onto become professional musicians. Fritelli was a member of the Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra and conductor of the Johannesburg Concerto Festival, and is now a Professor of Music at the University of Texas, Austin, USA. </p>
<p>More recent alumni to have achieved internationally acclaimed status in the music world include jazz musicians Vuma Levin (matric 2005), who credits belonging to the Sacred Heart Choir aged 14 as the catalyst for his career as an international award winning guitarist and composer, and Yamikani Mahaka-Phiri (matric 2009), renowned actor-cum-singer who performs on stage in South Africa and overseas. Levin and Mahaka-Phiri, along with South African music legend Sipho ‘Hotstix’ Mabuse, parent and grandparent to current pupils at the school, are some of those currently inspiring a thriving music scene for Sacred Heart learners.</p>

    <p>The Letebele Music Centre was opened in 2002 by Joseph Letebele and named for the family’s long history with and worthy contributions to the school community. The centre, which was converted from staff accommodation to a music block at the turn of the millenium to a music block contained one large teaching classroom and twelve small rooms for musical tuition and practice. </p>
<p>Today this space is no longer adequate for the needs of the Sacred Heart learners and funds are currently being raised for a new M.A.D Centre (Music, Arts and Drama Centre), which will allow music and arts to grow and flourish at Sacred Heart. Architectural plans have been drawn up for this new facility on the site of the existing sports kiosk. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Both the Primary and High Schools have several musical ensembles, including the seniors’ One Heart Choir, String and Woodwind Ensemble, The Sacred Heart Jazz band and a number of Marimba groups (including the featured Iyon Brew). As well as players of more traditional instruments there are a growing number of contemporary musicians and vocalists who refine their skills at school. </p>
<p>With a burgeoning and reinvigorated music scene at the school it is fitting that The One Heart Music Festival, annual hot ticket during the City of Johannesburg’s Heritage Day celebrations, showcases the combined talents of performers from Sacred Heart and other Marist schools alongside those more well known (both at home and abroad) such as Sipho ‘Hotstix’ Mabuse, Feya Faku, Judith Sephuma, MiCasa, Lira and Black Coffee. The Festival, which developed out of the Sacred Heart Cultural Festival and School Fête, raises awareness around xenophobia amidst the celebration of national heritages, with proceeds from tickets going towards funding the Three2Six school and, in recent years, the Field of Flowers (a scholarship fund enabling children from disadvantaged backgrounds to study at Sacred Heart College).</p>

    <p>The four existing members of the Sacred Heart Jazz Band, Riley Pam-Grant, Paul Stansell, Jeremy Crouch and Howard Su, were joined in 2016 by vocalists Lerato Dieterich, Angel Gwanda and Lethabo Sephuma. During an intense 2016, packed with rehearsals and workshops, Thangzz were finalists in both the &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; at St Mary&#39;s and the St Andrew&#39;s &quot;Viebz contemporary music&quot; competitions. Thangzz also performed, and wowed, the general public at Jazz on the Lawn in Cape Town (March 2016) and at the One Heart Music Festival in Johannesburg (September 2016). </p>
