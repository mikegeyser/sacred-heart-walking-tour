    <p>Sacred Heart College inspires and demands a social consciousness that reflects around and actively seeks practical ways to move forward through the complexity of South African society. Though the College ethos is undoubtedly underpinned by Christian (specifically Marist) principles, it is the richness in and appreciation of a shared spirituality expressed through love and mutual respect that draws from many cultures and faiths (Islam and Hinduism in particular since a large number of the school community come from these traditions). Shared values and a deep sense of justice and equality knits together community members into a common order. In fact, it is often most precisely because of the diversity within the Sacred Heart community that traditional values are honed and shared because each member can reflect on the common threads of humanity that bind them to each other. </p>
<p>The narratives in these slides are by no means a comprehensive collection of all the stories connected to individuals from Sacred Heart’s community who have actively contributed (and continue to contribute) towards positive change within society and to transformative dialogue around socio-political issues. Herewith is a selection of some of them. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Mr. Lowry, as a worker for the South African Catholic Bishops’ Conference (SACBC) and Mr. Molobi, were both been detained by the government during the 1980s. They were arrested because of their involvement in activities that promoted peace and justice during the years of the apartheid regime. During the 1970s Eric Molobi had been imprisoned on Robben Island for his work with the then-banned ANC. After his release Molobi, along with Sheila Sisulu, other community leaders and supported by the South African Council of Churches and the SACBC worked within two educationally focused activist groups; The Joint Enrichment Program (that dealt with civic leadership in townships and their school) and The National Education Crisis Committee. At the same time Molobi was administrator for the Kagiso Trust (that benefited black South Africans in the 1980s funded by the European Commission). Molobi later became CEO of the re-formed Kagiso Trust Investments from 1993 which continued to support and promote learning by young black South Africans once the new government took over.</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>“[Eric Molobi] was to play a variety of prominent roles in the struggle in the ensuing decade, perhaps, most prominently, in visiting Dr Mandela in Pollsmoor Prison to discuss the negotiations linked to the suspension of the armed struggle.</p>
<p>With the renewal of the state of emergency in 1988, Eric was pursued by the security police, whom he evaded for many months in a place of refuge supplied on the College premises. He would masquerade by day decked out in a peaked cap and the other paraphernalia of a chauffer’s uniform... Martha, his wife was employed by the college as a receptionist, a position she subsequently held for twenty years, until a year after Eric’s death in 2007. She soon became the resident mother figure. Many students over the years have had recourse to Martha for succour and advice. Martha is still a serving member on our board of trustees of the outreach programme to rural communities. “</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>In 1986 and 1987 Sacred Heart was the scene of talks between college students and those from the townships around the subject of schooling. By 1989 leaders from Sacred Heart College were included in the Five Freedoms Forum Delegation to meet with ANC leadership in Lusaka; as well as discussion of suspension of armed struggle and broader issues the enrolment the ANC’s leader’s children and grandchildren in school was arranged, assuming an imminent return from exile. On their return, many of the children enrolled at the College. Into the early 1990s the Sacred Heart teaching community, in conjunction with the Brothers, attended to local and national issues surrounding the rapidly changing socio-economic demographic of central Johannesburg and were instrumental in the setting up of Model D schools - ensuring educational provision for black pupils and continued employment for teachers from the white community as well as training for teachers from the black community. </p>

    <p>During the late 1970s and 1980s Sacred Heart College was undergoing a period of transformation. Not only did the school begin to admit pupils other than white boys by first becoming an Open school and then Co-Educational (the latter was not only done to consolidate three schools but also as part of a conscious move to destabilise the male-centric nature of the school and imbalances of power that were reflected in the apartheid regime (the disbanding of the Cadets and the de-structuring of the Prefect System were examples of this) that the college were moving away from. College Principal, Brother Neil McGurk and Brother Jude Pieterse (then Secretary General of SACBC and Chairperson of the SA Catholic Schools Association) were not only influential in the transformation of the school but also in the nation’s forthcoming socio-political transformations, particularly in the area of educational reforms. Both men were integral to negotiations with the Government, specifically in talks with the then Administrator of the Transvaal, Sybrand Van Niekerk and the Minister of National Education, Piet Koornhoff. These talks revealed the divisions beginning to appear within the apartheid regime surrounding principles of inclusion in education, with the Brothers offering Catholic principles of inclusivity as a basis for educational reform supported by international opinion regarding segregation in South Africa and concluding with discussions of how moving against the Open Schools would further damage international relations in the wake of Soweto, the death of Steve Biko and the cultural boycott. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Hearts into the Furture Cycle ride is held on Heritage Day prior to the One Heart Music Festival. Both events are intended to bring awareness to and conscientise around issues surrounding xenophobia. An 11-year-old College learner wrote of her fears and hopes in an ‘Open Letter’ during the outbursts of xenophobic violence in South Africa in April 2015. The letter subsequently went viral after it was posted by Principal Colin Northmore on social media, encouraging awareness of and activating against xenophobic discriminations.  SABC News circulated the learner’s message further.  The pupil, who used a pseudonym while writing, read the letter at a youth rally held in June of that year at Constitution Hill and it can be heard here. Sacred Heart College community remains driven by Marist principles, a diverse sanctuary-like school and microcosm of the positive possibilities of South African society. </p>

    text: "Sacred Heart College alumni Rekgofatse Chikane being arrested during the protests to support #FeesMustFall in the Cape Town parliamentary precinct in 2015. ",
    furtherText: `
    <p>The Co-Educational and Open policies of the school post 1980 afforded a multicultural, dynamic and balanced culture to the College which is often remarked on by those meeting alumni in the fields of further education and business. A confidence instilled in the individual through allowing no single grouping to dominate amongst the pupils – no sporting, academic or cultural merits are ranked more important than others, along side the cultivation of essential respect for the values of equality and freedoms, encouragement of critical thinking skills produces well balanced, respectful but equally opinionated and strong willed alumni.That many of the leaders in the 2015 and 2016 protests around access to education and its fee structures were alumni of Sacred Heart College came as no surprise. Pictured alumni Rekgofatse Chikane and Wits SRC Secretary General for 2016, Fasiha Hassan (matric 2011), are but two examples; many others, including some of the older students still attending the College also stepped forward to demonstrate their solidarity with the cause.</p>
<p>Rekgofatse Chikane, who in his final year at Sacred Heart was chairperson of the Learners Representative Council, is the son of Rev. Frank Chikane. Frank Chikane first associated with the school in 1971 when he came from Soweto to Observatory for extra Saturday lessons to boost his tuition before his matriculation exams that year. Later, in 1988 Frank Chikane, like Eric Molobi, was given refuge when he was being sought by the Security Police. He was harboured at the Holy Family Convent in Yeoville, by then a satellite premises for Sacred Heart. Though the property was raided and paper bombed, on the same night that Sacred Heart’s statue of Jesus was necklaced, Chikane was not at the property at the time. Later, however, Frank Chikane was subjected to a near-fatal poisoning which was surfaced during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>

    text: "Great-grandson of Walter Sisulu (and High School learner) meets Denis Goldberg at Liliesleaf during a school visit in 2016.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>There are many interconnections between individuals involved in the struggles and the Sacred Heart Community that can be traced over many years. This picture offers an insight into just one of these stories. Walter Sisulu and Denis Goldberg were two of ten liberationists arrested during a raid at Liliesleaf and subsequently imprisoned after the Rivonia Trial in 1964. Though the meeting of Denis Goldberg and Walter Sisulu’s grandson took place in 2016, the foundations of this particular narrative can be traced back through Sacred Heart to 1913. </p>
<p>In 1964 Joel Joffe was the attorney who took on defending the cases of Sisulu and Goldberg at the Rivonia Trial. Joffe was at ‘Obs’ and matriculated in 1948 with first class results. Bram Fischer, who was lead counsel of the defense team, chose to send his children to Sacred Heart College some years later. Nelson Mandela was convicted at the Rivonia Trial, having been found not guilty in the earlier Treason Trial of the 1950s. Many of his grandchildren attended Sacred Heart College. The leader of the Treason Trial defense team was Israel Maisels, perhaps better known as Isie Maisels Q.C., a Sacred Heart College (Koch Street) alumnus. Liliesleaf Farm was used as a hideout for many of those connected to the ANC and other liberationist movements whose workings had been strengthened in the wake of the Treason Trial’s outcome. It is fitting that Sacred Heart College learners visit this site, amongst others during school outings, to further their understanding of their community’s involvement in the transformative forces in South African society.</p>
