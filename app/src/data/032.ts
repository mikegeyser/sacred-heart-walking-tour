    <p>Sacred Heart College inspires and demands a social consciousness that reflects on and actively seeks practical ways to move forward through the complexity of South African society. Though the College ethos is undoubtedly underpinned by Catholic (specifically Marist) principles, it draws from many cultures and faiths (Islam and Hinduism in particular, since a large number of the school community come from these traditions). Shared values and a deep sense of justice and equality knit together community members into a common order, expressed through love and mutual respect. In fact, it is often most precisely because of the diversity within the Sacred Heart community that traditional values are honed and shared, because each member can reflect on the common threads of humanity that bind them to each other. </p>
<p>The narratives in these slides are by no means a comprehensive collection of all the stories connected to individuals from Sacred Heart’s community who have actively contributed (and continue to contribute) towards positive change within society and to transformative dialogue around socio-political issues. Herewith is a selection of some of them. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Mr. Lowry, as a worker for the South African Catholic Bishops’ Conference (SACBC), and Mr. Molobi were both detained by the government during the 1980s. They were arrested because of their involvement in activities that promoted peace and justice during the years of the apartheid regime. During the 1970s Eric Molobi had been imprisoned on Robben Island for his work with the then-banned ANC. After his release Molobi, along with Sheila Sisulu, other community leaders, and supported by the South African Council of Churches and the SACBC worked within two educationally focused activist groups: the Joint Enrichment Programme (that dealt with civic leadership in townships and schools) and the National Education Crisis Committee. At the same time Molobi was administrator for the Kagiso Trust that benefited black South Africans in the 1980s, funded by the European Commission. In 1993 Molobi became CEO of the re-formed Kagiso Trust Investments, which continued to support and promote learning by young black South Africans after the ANC came to power. </p>

    <blockquote>
<p>“[Eric Molobi] was to play a variety of prominent roles in the struggle in the ensuing decade, perhaps, most prominently, in visiting Dr Mandela in Pollsmoor Prison to discuss the negotiations linked to the suspension of the armed struggle.</p>
<p>With the renewal of the state of emergency in 1988, Eric was pursued by the security police, whom he evaded for many months in a place of refuge supplied on the College premises. He would masquerade by day decked out in a peaked cap and the other paraphernalia of a chauffeur’s uniform... Martha, his wife was employed by the college as a receptionist, a position she subsequently held for twenty years, until a year after Eric’s death in 2007. She soon became the resident mother figure. Many students over the years have had recourse to Martha for succour and advice. Martha is still a serving member on our board of trustees of the outreach programme to rural communities. “</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>In 1986 and 1987, Sacred Heart hosted talks between College and township students on the subject of schooling. In 1989, leaders from Sacred Heart College were included in the Five Freedoms Forum Delegation to meet with ANC leadership in Lusaka. As well as discussing the suspension of armed struggle, questions around the school enrolment of the exiles’ children and grandchildren were addressed, assuming an imminent return. Many of those children later enrolled at the College. Into the early 1990s the Sacred Heart teaching community, in conjunction with the Brothers, attended to local and national issues surrounding the rapidly changing socio-economic demographic of central Johannesburg, and were instrumental in the setting up of Model D schools – ensuring educational provision for black pupils, training for teachers from the black community, and continued employment for teachers from the white community. </p>

    <p>During the late 1970s and 1980s, Sacred Heart College was undergoing a period of transformation. The school began to admit pupils other than white boys, first becoming an open school and then co-educational. The latter was not only done to consolidate three schools, but was part of a conscious move to destabilise the male-centric nature of the school and imbalances of power inherited from apartheid. The College was deliberately moving away from this old order, which also entailed the disbanding of the Cadets and the de-structuring of the Prefect System. College Principal, Brother Neil McGurk, and Brother Jude Pieterse (then Secretary General of SACBC and Chairperson of the SA Catholic Schools Association) were not only influential in the nation’s forthcoming socio-political transformations, particularly in the area of educational reforms, but were also integral to negotiations with the apartheid government, specifically in talks with the then Administrator of the Transvaal, Sybrand van Niekerk and the Minister of National Education, Piet Koornhof. These talks revealed the divisions beginning to appear within the apartheid regime regarding principles of inclusion in education, with the Brothers offering Catholic principles of inclusivity as a basis for educational reform. This was supported by international opinion regarding segregation in South Africa. The talks concluded with discussions on how moving against the open schools would further damage international relations in the wake of Soweto, the death of Steve Biko, and the cultural boycott. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Hearts into the Future Cycle ride is held on Heritage Day, prior to the One Heart Music Festival. Both events are intended to bring awareness of issues surrounding xenophobia. An 11-year-old College learner wrote of her fears and hopes in an ‘Open Letter’ during the outbursts of xenophobic violence in South Africa in April 2015. The letter subsequently went viral after it was posted by Principal Colin Northmore on social media, encouraging awareness of and activating against xenophobic discriminations. SABC News circulated the learner’s message further. The pupil, who used a pseudonym while writing, read the letter at a youth rally held in June of that year at Constitution Hill and it can be heard here. The Sacred Heart College community remains driven by Marist principles, a diverse, sanctuary-like school and is a microcosm of the positive possibilities of South African society. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The College provides a balanced, multicultural and dynamic environment. Confidence is instilled in the individual through allowing no single pupil grouping to dominate; no sporting, academic or cultural merits are ranked more important than others. The Marist ethos cultivates proactivity around the values of equality and freedom. The development of critical thinking skills, through an ever-innovating curriculum, produces well balanced, respectful but equally opinionated and strong willed alumni; something which is often remarked on by those meeting alumni in the fields of further education and business. That many of the leaders in the 2015 and 2016 protests around access to education and its fee structures were alumni of Sacred Heart College came as no surprise. Rekgotsofetse Chikane (pictured) and Wits SRC Secretary General for 2016, Fasiha Hassan (matric 2011), are but two examples; many others, including some of the older students still attending the College, also stepped forward to demonstrate their solidarity with the cause. </p>
<p>Rekgotsofetse Chikane, who in his final year at Sacred Heart was president of the Learners’ Representative Council, is the son of Rev. Frank Chikane. Frank Chikane first associated with the school in 1971 when he came from Soweto to Observatory for extra Saturday lessons to boost his tuition before his matriculation exams that year. In 1988, Frank Chikane, like Eric Molobi, was given refuge by the Marists when he was being sought by the Security Police at the Holy Family Convent in Yeoville, by then a satellite premises for Sacred Heart. The property was raided and paper bombed on the same night that Sacred Heart’s statue of Jesus was necklaced, but Chikane was not found. Later, however, Frank Chikane was subjected to a near-fatal poisoning, which he spoke about at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. </p>

    text: "Xhamela Sisulu, great-grandson of Walter Sisulu (and High School learner) meets Denis Goldberg at Liliesleaf Farm in 2016.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>There are many interconnections between individuals involved in the struggles and the Sacred Heart Community that can be traced over many years. This picture offers an insight into just one of these stories. Walter Sisulu and Denis Goldberg were two of ten liberation activists arrested during a raid at Liliesleaf and subsequently imprisoned after the Rivonia Trial in 1964. Though the meeting of Denis Goldberg and Walter Sisulu’s grandson took place in 2016, the foundations of this particular narrative can be traced back through Sacred Heart to 1913. </p>
<p>The leader of the 1956 Treason Trial defence team was Israel Maisels, who started at Koch Street in 1913. Nelson Mandela, Sisulu and 154 others were charged with treason but were all found not guilty. In 1964 Joel Joffe, an ‘Obs’ alumnus, was one of the attorneys who defended Mandela, Sisulu and Denis Goldberg at the Rivonia Trial. A number of the Mandela and Sisulu grandchildren and great-grandchildren attended Sacred Heart College. Liliesleaf Farm was used as a hideout for leaders of the liberation struggle. It is fitting that Sacred Heart College learners visit this site to further their understanding of their community’s involvement in the struggle for freedom in South Africa.</p>
