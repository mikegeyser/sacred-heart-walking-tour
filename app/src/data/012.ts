    <p>The Brothers lived, as they do today, in community residence at Marist institutions that they served. Prior to 1985, the Brothers based at Sacred Heart College lived in rooms on the upper floor of the main building which today have been converted into the staff room and several offices (including those of the school counsellor and the chaplain). In 1985 a new residence was completed for the Brothers which provided rooms for 11 Brothers, a mall Chapel space, a dining room and a communal lounge. The single storey building, partly incorporating the Manual Training Hall, was practically designed to comfortably accommodate more elderly Brothers. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Vidal arrived in South Africa in 1902 suffering ‘galloping consumption’ (tuberculosis) and doctors in Cape Town gave him three months to live. He moved to Johannesburg where the altitude strengthened his lungs and astounded the medical profession by not only living to the age of 95 but by becoming a PT teacher, gymnastics enthusiast and soccer coach.  Another article in The Star (undated) reported that he volunteered as a traffic cop ensuring that learners were able to safely cross the roads to and from school.  The 1962 Maristonian remarked in his obituary that “perhaps he will be best remembered among the laity for his many remedies for almost all sorts of diseases. For some these proved beneficial, for others a trial that was not repeated.” Brother Martin, the late Marist Archivist, kept a list of his remedies and noted that it was the ‘Hail Marys’ offered at the end of each treatment that were the only potentially non-lethal part of the process!</p>
<p>Over the 150 years that the Marists have been in Johannesburg many hundreds of Brothers have served to educate the youth at the three Guateng Marist schools and whose presence have impacted the wider community in numerous ways. Some of these Brothers are mentioned in this App; these are but a selection. In this group of slides the main focus is on the Brothers who lived, or continue to live, at the Eckstein Street Brothers’ Residence. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Paul became a Marist Brother just a few years after finshing school in Johannesburg in 1924 (at Athlone Boys’ High School). Brother Paul trained in Italy and on returning to South Africa in 1926 and taught at many of the Marist Schools, including Koch Street and Observatory. He was elected to represent the South African Brothers at the General House in Italy in 1946 where he spent the next ten years. In 1957, having suffered degenerative eyesight during his time in Italy, he had an operation in London. The operation was not successful and Brother Paul was thereafter totally blind. </p>
<p>Brother Paul returned to South Africa to live with the Brothers at Observatory (where he remained until 1998 when he moved to Nazareth House when he needed the support of a Nursing Home). The boys at the school organised a collection for Brother Paul to buy his guide dog. He learnt braille and immersed himself in charitable work to assist the blind, particularly in social welfare. In 1967, Brother Paul founded “The Guild of St.Theresa’s for the Blind”, a charitable institution, assisted by the Sisters of Charity to practically assist and financially support the blind in disadvantaged communities. The Siloe School for the Blind, near Pietermaritzburg, is one of the foundations supported by St. Theresa’s Guild. Brother Paul’s Obituary, published in 2000 in the College yearbook, commented that the children at the Siloe School (a Catholic foundation) know more about Brother Paul than the Pope!</p>

    <p>Brother Jude, describes himself as ‘working with young people’ but this only tells one small portion (though with a huge impact) of his contributions to the progress made in South African society in the struggle against apartheid and the desegregation of its education system. Educated at St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch from Standard 4, he professed his first Marist vows in 1959. Brother Jude has taught in several Marist schools in South Africa and Australia, including Sacred Heart College, and served as Principal at the Marist College in Port Elizabeth. In 1974 Br Jude was appointed the first Marist Provincial of Southern Africa, created to administer for six countries on the continent rather than just South Africa (as the Province had been since 1908), and served another two terms in this role from 1995. In the late 1970s Brother Jude became part of the Chapter of Brothers in Rome and still fulfils this position as Councillor for the Southern African Province. </p>
<p>Brother Jude founded the Catholic Institute of Education in 1985, an associated body of the  Southern African Catholic Bishops’ Conference, of which he was Secretary General at the time. Over the years he has served on a variety of committees, boards and trusts relating to the development of Catholic education and effected an inordinate amount of transformation through these roles. In recent years Brother Jude set up the Marist Schools Council and much of his time is devoted to effecting change through this body. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Born in Port Elizabeth, Br Joseph was educated at Marist College in Uitenhage (as was his father) and after the Marist Juniorate in Hibberdene, KZN. Like all Marist Brothers of his generation he spent several years at a Juniorate (where they completed Matric with focus on their vocational choice), another year in a Postulancy (preparation to enter the next stage of Marist formation) and a further year at a Novitiate (during which ones’ first vows are made). Brother Joseph’s Novitiate year included teaching practice at St. David’s College, Inanda and thereafter he taught at Marian College, Linmeyer and St.Charles’ College, Pietermaritzburg and St. Joseph’s, Rondebosch (where he was Primary School Principal). In the 1980s Brother Joseph was the founder Principal of Trinity House school in Port Elizabeth (a joint venture between the Marists and the Dominican Sisters) and during this time was also Superintendent for the Diocesan Mission Schools. </p>
<p>From 1991-2000 Brother Joseph was Principal of the Primary School at Sacred Heart College which he fondly recalls as ‘a great ten years of my apostolic life’. Brother Joseph oversaw the move of the Primary School back to the Eckstein Street premises from its temporary home in Yeoville.  Brother Joseph, a gentle but firm, much loved Principal was appointed by Rome to oversee new Brothers’ formation in Kenya in 2000. In 2005 he returned to live at the Brothers’ Residence at Sacred Heart on his election as Deputy Marist Provincial and from 2010-2016 served two terms as Marist Provincial for Southern Africa. Brother Joseph has recently moved from Observatory to continue Marist mission work in the Western Cape. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Mario learnt the war cry for St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch well before he became there a pupil in the early 1940s, from his elder brother. Aged 15 he decided to become a Marist and moved to the Hibberdene Juniorate to complete his schooling. After his Postulancy and Novitiate in Australia, completed contemporaneously with Brother Jude, he returned to South Africa. Studying through UNISA he completed his teaching practice at Sacred Heart College, then Marist ‘Obs’, teaching amongst other subjects, Afrikaans. Brother Mario taught at a number of Marist schools including fourteen years at St. David’s College, Inanda. Brother Mario continues to help with formation of the spiritual life of St. David’s today. After studying on a bursary at Berkeley, California in the late 1970s, Brother Mario set to training young Marists, first at Seminaries in former homelands of Transkei and Bophuthatswana, later in Kenya running the teaching practice department at the Marist International University College for eight years. He also undertook further studies, in the sciences, at the University of Louvain in Belgium and in Rome. </p>
<p>Brother Mario returned to Johannesburg, living in the Brother’s Residence from 1999-2005, and continued to focus on teacher training, though this time of lay Marists involved in all five South African Marist schools. From 2005-2010, based in Cape Town and Uitenhage he continued to run workshops for lay Marists until being appointed Secretary to Brother Joseph, then Marist Provincial, and he returned to live in Observatory. Brother Mario continues to write educational support materials for the Institute of Marist Brothers. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Vincent’s connection with the Marist Brothers began as an 11-year-old boarder at St. Charles’ College, Pietermaritzburg in 1956. He took his first vows in 1968 at the Stellenbosch Novitiate (together with Brother Joseph). In 1972 Brother Vincent came to Marist ‘Obs’ to teach Standard 5, sports and the Cadet band. Brother Vincent recalls he and Brother Neil (part of the staff by then) walking to Ellis Park Stadium and the Yeoville Bioscope at the weekends. They threw gravel up to the windows of the Brother’s corridor to awaken someone to open up if they arrived back after the internal gates were locked (his room is now occupied by the College Counsellor). </p>
<p>After fifteen years teaching PE between Marist schools in Port Elizabeth and Durban, he was posted to the Slough Marist mission in the Kalahari in 1986. There, Brother Vincent cultivated his interest in practical work, qualifying for a diploma in Technical Studies at Wits’ Technikon in the late 1980s. He taught Technical Studies at Slough, Uitenhage and in Port Elizabeth until 2007 when he transferred back to Sacred Heart taking over as Maintenance Manager, a role which he continues today.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Neil, whose father Gerald McGurk taught at Sacred Heart College for 43 years and whose uncle Edwin McGurk was Provincial in the late 1950s and early 1960s, began his own journey Marist ‘Obs’ aged 14. After making his first Marist vows and teaching in Australia, Brother Neil began teaching science at Marist ‘Obs’ in 1965. A veritable academic, with reams of published research in topics as diverse education and race, cosmology and nucleic forces, Brother Neil has inspired generations of learners. From 1975 to 1999 he was Director of the College. Sim Tshabalala, now joint CEO of Standard Bank and one of the first black students that Brother Neil admitted to the College said of his former Headmaster:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I learned a lot from him and in particular, I gained a love of philosophy and deep desire to help out – at least a little – to make South Africa a better place.”  (Tshabalala, 2011)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under Br Neil’s leadership, the College defied government decree and opened the school to boys of all races in 1976. In 1980, he was responsible for the change to co-education. Outside of the College’s community, Br Neil has made invaluable contributions to South African society including negotiating educational reform with the pre-1994 Government leading to the remodelling and desegregation of schools, assisting the ANC before and after its unbanning with socio-cultural missions and the integration of the returning exiles in conjunction with the Batlagae trust. Br Neil continues to work tirelessly for social development with Catholic NGOs in the country; one current project ‘The Culture of Learning’ in KZN provides skill training in education and community development.  </p>

    <p>Father Dryden, not a Marist Brother but a Jesuit priest, has been the Sacred Heart College Chaplain since 1983 after serving at St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch for the previous decade. Father Dryden is concurrently the Chaplain at Marian College, Linmeyer and spends half of the week at each school. Marist Brothers are not priests, but have nonetheless made vows to live a spiritual life in community with other Brothers, focused on education as their founder, Marcellin Champagnat (who was a priest), established in 1817. </p>
<p>Father Dryden’s duties as Chaplain include pastoral care, religious instruction for Catholic children and religious education in a general sense as well as the conduction of Masses and other special ceremonies (such as First Holy Communion and Confirmation). He has contact in these capacities with all ages at the school, from Pre-Primary to Matric and with staff members.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>This statue of Our Lady of Good Hope was made in Europe and sent by Brother Procope, Marist Superior in the 1880s, to the Marist College at Uitenhage, Our Lady of Good Hope College at a cost of £7 and 15 schillings according to the Uitenhage annals of 1890 recorded by Brother Nectaire. When that College closed in the 1950s it was moved to the Brother’s Residence in Walmer, Port Elizabeth where the Brothers in that area continued to live. When Brother Joseph became Principal of the Primary School at Sacred Heart College he arranged for the statue to be moved to Johannesburg for it was no longer displayed in a prominent place in Walmer having developed a fondness for the statue during his days as a learner at the Marist College in Uitenhage.  When Brother Joseph was made Provincial in 2010 he arranged for a copy of the statue to be made and it is this copy that sits in the niche in the College façade today. The niche had been empty for nearly thirty years after the statue of Jesus with the Sacred Heart was moved from that spot in 1979 to coincide with the school reverting to the use of its religious name when it became co-educational in 1980. </p>
