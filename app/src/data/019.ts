    <p>The Marist Brothers Cadet Corps was founded in 1895. The Cadet Corps had made their first official appearance at the Rand Agricultural Show of that same year and there attracted the attention of the President, Paul Kruger. The State decreed them a Naval Brigade and dressed the boys in sailor suits and provided Martini-Henry Carbines and Bayonets. The young ‘middies’, as they were known at that time (‘middies’ being an abbreviation of midshipman another name for a sailor) financed their own ammunition and military training. That they were a Naval Brigade was probably due to the hopes of the then Republican Government to annex Natal and extend the Republic to become a maritime colony. </p>
<p>Later, the corps acted as a bodyguard to President Kruger when he addressed the people of Johannesburg at the Union Grounds (which was also used, along side the Old Wanderers grounds, as a sports field and for Cadet drills by the boys at Koch Street). Not long after, during the South African War, the corps was furnished with dummy rifles and then disbanded after an official mandate was sent from Pretoria by the Republican Government “incase they prove a menace to the state.” </p>

    <p>In 1903 the Marist Cadet Corps was reformed and in 1904 they received official recognition from the Government and South African Military. This was in part due to the efforts of many military enthusiasts amongst the Old Boys, who had formed their own association in 1902. The Cadet Corps was gazetted several officers from the South African Military including Lieutenant-Colonel Max Langerman, Captain G. Hartog, Captain R. Goldberg, Captain G. H. Roy who was Adjutant (i.e. most senior in rank), Lieutenant F. Ingle, Lieutenant L. Lewison and Lieutenant W. McDonald. They were responsible for the training of the student and staff Officer Body and oversaw drills, displays and prepared them for competitions. All of whom, except Max Langerman, were alumni of Koch Street. The corps gained a reputation in particular for producing excellent marksmen and had their own Reed and Brass Bands. </p>

    <p>When the Cadet Corps was reformed it was affiliated to the Transvaal Scottish Volunteers and guided by their Captain, George Herbert Roy. In 1906 Captain Roy oversaw the commissioning of several of the Marist Brothers, approved by the then Principal of Koch Street, Brother Callixte. At this time the Koch Street Annual Report to the parent body revealed some of the concerns of the parent body around the Cadet Corps’ existence and this document also relays some of the historical sentiment around the purpose of the Cadets.</p>

    <p>By the 1930s the Cadet Corps had grown so large that the detachment had three full companies; Infantry Troops (the backbone of the Corps), a Platoon of Signaleers (responsible for military communications) and a Platoon trained in Trench Mortar and Bren Gun deployment (specialising in weaponry). The Cadet Band, now a mixed orchestral marching band, was a regularly anticipated feature of school pageants and until only recently did the College Band, ‘March On,’ leading participants to swimming galas and athletics meetings.</p>

<p>Such was the standing of the Marist Cadet Corps that it was regularly invited to perform in official state duties and 1931 General F. Theron came to inspect the Cadets at Observatory, a photo of which appeared in the Rand Daily Mail. In 1947 school cadet corps lined Louis Botha Avenue (then the main road in and out of Johannesburg) to stand to attention in honour of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (and the Princesses, one now Queen Elizabeth II) whose Rolls Royce drove past en route to Pretoria.</p>

    <p>The late Captain Roy’s sword was presented to the College Cadet Corps by his sister Edith Pooley in 1935 along with other memorabilia kept by Captain Roy such as photo albums of cadet camps, badges and some documents. The sword, embossed with an inscription that reads ‘Marist Bros Cadet Corps’, is still in the possession of the school. The sword made of solid silver, wood and leather is about 105 cm in length and has an intricately carved handle depicting the monogram of King Edward VII (dating the sword to the early 1900s), the monarch who reorganised the British Forces after the Anglo-Boer War, including the company to which the Marist Cadet Corps was affiliated. The blade (81cm) is still protected by its original leather scabbard. </p>

    <p> Tuesdays, afternoons were given over to Cadet training – drills, shooting practice (using live ammunition). The Brothers would change out of their soutanes and into dog-collared military uniforms to assist Sergeants specially employed to run the Cadets. In the Summer months the cricket oval was used as the Cadet training ground, with the ruby fields used in the winter. </p>
<p>The Cadet Corps was compulsory for all boys aged 13 in accordance with the national Defense Acts until the Cadets was disbanded at the school in the early 1980s. The disbanding of the Cadets was something of a controversial move by the school, and contributed to the numerous confrontations with government officials at the time over issues such as the school’s rejection of the quota system (whereby the number of black students was meant to be limited in order for the school to retain a government subsidy). By the 1980s, the school administration felt that the presence of Cadets contributed to the military culture prevalent within White society at the time which was not in keeping with the inclusive ethos that the school was demonstrably pioneering. With authority structures being widely discredited through the political struggle in the country it was decided that bastions of such traditional thinking were not appropriate to the school’s progressive and inclusive ethos and thus the Cadets and the Prefect system were disbanded. The latter was replaced with a Student Representative Council which involved students as leaders in the school rather than as subject to the whims of individuals and particular power dynamics. </p>

    <p>Until the disbanding of the Cadets there was an Armoury at the school. The Armoury at Obs contained Cadet kit (including uniform, drums, bugles and other band instruments) as well as relics from the South African War and the First and Second World Wars. .303 (which no longer worked) and .22 calibre rifles.  The school shooting range, paid for by the South African military authorities in the 1920s, was situated in the far corner of the school grounds where the cricket nets now are found. When Koch street premises was demolished, used ammunition was found embedded in the walls, left over from when shooting practice took place in the school yard. It would not be impossible to find similar debris buried where cricket balls land in Observatory today. The former Armoury’s cache of weapons has been replaced with a very different kind of battery cluster as today it is used as the Primary School Computer Centre.</p>

    <p>Cadet Camp was also a regular side feature of the Cadet Corp at the College. Though the Cadets were disbanded, the camp experience was maintained for its team building and independence encouraging activities for learners from Grade 4 onwards. Camp activities today are a little less rigid than in times gone by. </p>

    <p>The College opened its first Computer Centre in 1984 with fifteen Ataris and four IBM PCs for use by its learners – initially for the Primary School but soon after extended for the High School learners as well. The collection of computers grew as fast as funding would allow; initially, to recoup some of the costs involved a computer club was set up for staff and learners to join outside of classroom hours – at R10 per person. Today the Primary School computer centre has been updated with flat-screened desktops and the school is equipped throughout with a wifi network and Apple products (Apple TV, desktops and iPads) and all High School learners participate in the BYOD (bring your own device) program which enables workforce ready students who can collaborate in up to the minute ways and seamlessly transfer their learning outside of the classroom. Provision at the College introduces leaners to coding, app development and game design as well as the more traditional IT skills.  </p>
