With the spread of Johannesburg, a town not much older than Sacred Heart College itself, space was at a premium and no more existed at Koch Street or in its direct surrounds. Sporting events (and overspill at break-time for even the playground space was inadequate) were held at the (Old) Wanderers Grounds, a few blocks walk away and across the railway tracks. The Brothers decided then that another premises was necessary if they were to continue to expand their teaching provisions alongside the growing city (though Johannesburg was only officially designated as a city in 1928). The First World War (1914-18) delayed focus on the search for another property but in 1919 32 acres of land on Observatory ridge, then outside Johannesburg, were purchased by the Brothers. </p>\n\n    ",

The architect, Mr P.J. Hill was a former Marist pupil, having been taught by the Brothers at Uitenhage. Much of the blasting was completed by Brother Henry who took out a special licence in order to do so and the grounds were landscaped under the direction of Brother Florian, a keen botanist, who was to become the first Principal of the College. </p>\n<p>The new school opened on 1st February 1926 in Observatory to approximately 250 pupils - the senior classes, from Standard II (Grade 4 today) to Matric, from Koch Street were moved to the new premises.</p>\n\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>Sacred Heart College at Koch Street became the preparatory school to Observatory. Brother Martin, Marist Archivist, noted that the Observatory school was to be the preparatory school, with Koch Street the senior school; this we know didn\u2019t happen, perhaps due to the superior sporting facilities at Observatory being preferred for senior boys. The early 1900s saw several other boys\u2019 schools open like Johannesburg College (later renamed King Edward VII School (K.E.S), St. John\u2019s and Jeppe High School for Boys; it was likely that in order to compete with these schools on a sporting level the decision was reversed. Interestingly, the school name is not given in this advertisement \u2013 only Marist Brothers\u2019 New College. The original College name as suggested in archival material, was St Benedict\u2019s (to differentiate from Sacred Heart College at Koch Street). The name Sacred Heart College is recorded in documents from the 1930s, but Marist Brothers College or Marist \u2018Obs\u2019 (a shortened form of Observatory) were used colloquially until the 1980s.</p>\n\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>The first few years at Obs were years of expansion \u2013  in terms of both buildings and pupil numbers. In this image you can just make out the Hall building to the right of the main building. Another feature of the college which don\u2019t exist today are the open upper walkways which lead from the northern and southern ends of the main building towards the central facade. Later these were covered over and used to extend the interior space on the upper level. One of the first \u2018extras\u2019 was the swimming pool added in 1930. The school opened as a school for boys \u2013 white boys \u2013 with some Chinese pupils being admitted in the 1930s. Obs, like Sacred Heart at Koch Street, also offered boarding facilities. The number of pupils grew so quickly that a new wing was added in 1931 which added several classrooms, Chaplain\u2019s quarters, a library, a sanatorium and a second dormitory. This is the building that today houses the Marist Provincial Offices and a number of classrooms, situated parallel to the Hall. </p>\n<p>At the time of opening there were 12 teaching Brothers assisted by several specialist lay-teachers including alumnus Mr. W. Singleton who until then taught at Koch Street. Sources record that \u201Cthe boys were full of admiration for the well \u2013 ventilated classrooms, the hall, the tennis-courts and the wide open spaces.\u201D</p>\n\n    ",

Observatory, Joburg\u2019 was added by the Post Office, identifying Obs as the \u2018biggest school\u2019 in the Transvaal \u2013 by 1932 Johannesburg was already by far the largest city in South Africa. That Obs was recognised as the \u2018Biggest School\u2019 in the city speaks volumes about its then reputation. This reputation initially extended from that of its mother school in Koch Street but in very little time Obs was to become the Marist \u2018monument\u2019 that it remains today. Some documents in the archives give the letter the arrival date of 1932, but others 1952. In any case, a remarkable artefact.</p>\n<p>By the mid 1930s the school numbers were close to 400 and a new classroom block was added (now part of the junior primary quad) and further sporting facilities added. The school was full to capacity and Koch Street was by now again oversubscribed, particularly for both schools in the boarding departments. By the early 1940s Obs had over 600 pupils and more primary aged pupils were admitted to the school (meaning that Koch Street was not the only preparatory school, though it continued to take the very youngest Marist pupils). The Marist Brothers sought to acquire another site and in 1941 St. David\u2019s Inanda was opened.  </p>\n\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>Though the expansions of the school buildings speak about the physical changes of the school terms of pupil numbers and improvements to facilities, the transformations of the Sacred Heart community should rather be understood in terms of its socio-cultural developments. The school at Koch Street, whilst a Catholic school, welcomed pupils of different religious backgrounds its daughter school, Sacred Heart College Observatory, did the same. Jewish learners were supported by weekly instruction from a visiting Rabbi in the 1930s and 40s while Catholic pupils were encouraged in Catechism and could belong to Sodalities (societies focused on faith). The South African Catholic Bishops Conference (SACBC), to whom the Marists belonged (and in the 1930s had hosted at Observatory) had been publically denouncing discriminatory policies. In 1975 the SACBC declared their position around Open Schooling (racially integrated) and not long after the Soweto uprising brought to the fore this issue at home and internationally. In 1976 no school magazine was produced. By no means was this was to erase the significance of this year but rather highlights a turning point in the history of the school. Between 1976-1980 the school become Open and Co-Educational. </p>\n<p>Former Principal, Steven Lowry, wrote in 2002:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201CFrom 1976 the school was led by Brother Neil McGurk who had an inspired vision of what education could be in the South Africa of 25 years ago. The Marist Brothers\u2019 understanding of their mission led them to defy government decree and open the school to boys of all races. However the newcomers did not present a real challenge to the school\u2026 The real cultural revolution probably took place four years later when in 1980 girls were first admitted to the school when it amalgamated with two near-by convents. \u201CMarist Brothers\u2019 \u2013 Observatory\u201D reverted to its religious name, Sacred Heart College.\u201D</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n    ",
