    <p>Born in <strong>Le Rosey,*</strong> Marhles, the ninth of ten children, Champagnat spent his early years working on his family’s farm, as he’d vowed not to return to school after witnessing cruelty to, and humiliation of, the school pupils. This experience, and the deep religious faith of his mother and aunt, shaped his life’s path, inspiring his religious vocation and his drive for compassionate education. Despite no formal early schooling, Champagnat wanted to study to become a priest and aged 15 entered a seminary (after twice sitting the entrance exams). He was ordained, aged 26, on 22nd July 1816. The next day Champagnat and some other newly ordained priests went to <strong>Fourvière</strong>, to the shrine of Mary, to pledge their fidelity to her. Together they created a group (to be made up of priests, sisters and lay people) called The Society of Mary with the intention of carrying out their ordained life dedicated to following the example of Mary and to emulate the loving relationship between her and Jesus. </p>

    <p>Aged 27 and Curate of the village of <strong>La Valla,*</strong> Marcellin Champagnat visited a sick boy, Jean-Baptiste Montagne, in the remote village of <strong>Les Palais</strong>. The boy died and Champagnat was troubled that he did so without having had any education, spiritual or otherwise. For Champagnat, this experience was a message from God. Thereon, Champagnat vowed to form a brotherhood of teachers to lovingly educate children at the margins of society. On 2nd January 1817, in <strong>La Valla</strong> Champagnat founded Les Petits Frères de Marie (The Little Brothers of Mary or Marist Brothers). In 1823, trapped by heavy falling snow in the mountains near <strong>Graix</strong>, Champagnat prayed to Mary asking for protection, and to her he attributed his survival. Growing quickly, (from three to nearly 30 Brothers in just over five years) the Marist Brotherhood needed new premises, and <strong>Notre Dame De L&#39;Hermitage</strong> opened near St Chamond in 1825. Champagnat, trained in metal and woodwork by his father while working on the family farm, designed and built L’Hermitage, aided by twenty Brothers and local artisans.</p>

    text: "One of the Ordinands with whom Champagnat (top left) pledged to Mary at Fourvière was Fr Jean-Claude Colin (bottom left), who formed a group of priests with a missionary purpose, Les Pères Maristes (Marist Fathers). Colin invited Nuns Jeanne-Marie Chavoin (top right) and Marie Françoise Perroto (bottom right) to begin the Sisters of the Congregation of Mary, the Marist Missionary Sisters.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Marcellin Champagnat regarded Jean-Claude Colin as the first Marist, as he was the lead founder of the Society of Mary. Even during Champagnat’s lifetime, however, the Marist Brothers (and of course today a much wider audience) regard Champagnat as such. With the Marist Brothers, the Fathers and Sisters became the first three parts of the Society of Mary, officially approved by Rome in 1834. In 1836 the Lay Marists were officialised by Rome as the fourth branch of the Society of Mary.</p>
<p>In 1863 the Marist Brothers were given autonomous institutional status as the Fratres Maristae a Scholis (FMS) or Marist Brothers of the Schools. Each section of the society fulfilled a particularly unique purpose. The Marist Fathers focus on missionary work. The Marist Brothers have their particular calling within education, following in the footsteps of the order of Brothers that Marcellin Champagnat started in 1817, at La Valla. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The intertwined AM monogram in the centre of this crest (seen on many of the Marist school blazers, though no longer on Sacred Heart’s) stands for Ad Mariam, a shortened form of Ad Jesum per Mariam (to Jesus through Mary), the Marist motto.  The twelve stars and crown are taken from the symbolism in the book of Revelation (21:1) which Catholics interpret as signifying the coronation of Mary and referencing the twelve tribes of Israel / twelve disciples (themselves representative of all peoples like the international Marist congregation). </p>
<p>The three violets represent the virtues of humility, simplicity and modesty that Champagnat espoused. Just as the actual violet is tiny in size but has a strong, beautiful and lingering fragrance, these virtues are huge powerhouses for good, despite their outward quietness. Currently there are Marist Brothers and schools in 80 countries worldwide.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Thomas Grimley, Bishop of the Cape of Good Hope (Western Division), asked Pope Pius XI to send some teaching Brothers to start a school for Catholic children in his diocese and, in turn, the Pope asked the Superior General of Marist Brothers to help. In April 1867, five Marist Brothers arrived in South Africa at Simon’s Town after 62 days at sea on a gunship, ‘L’Ephigenie’.  These Brothers (two from France and one each from Belgium, Ireland and England) set up two schools that year in Cape Town. St. Aloysius’ School (financed by the Colonial government) opened with ninety-four pupils and St. Joseph’s Academy (fee paying) with nine pupils. They were the first Marist schools outside of Europe, set up side by side in Hatfield Street.  Bishops in other South African dioceses, emboldened by the success, began to ask for Marist Brothers. </p>

    <p>A film produced in 2014 charting the early beginnings of the Marist Brotherhood and the development of the existing Marist schools in South Africa. Formally Sacred Heart College, informally the Koch Street school was known as Marist Johannesburg. The film explores the unique pedagogy of the Marists and the particular ethos of their schools today. There are plans to open another Marist school in Johannesburg in the near future.</p>
<p>Though twenty Marist schools and training missions opened in South Africa following 1867, only five remain in 2017. The Marist institute cites contributing factors as including language/religion and the socio-political structure of South Africa, clashes between the influences of Catholic social teachings following Vatican II and the apartheid government (particularly during the years 1940-1990), the effects of the first and second World Wars (many Brothers were conscripted), the sourcing of Brothers elsewhere internationally, and issues of funding.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Prior to 1908, the Marists in South Africa were bound by administration in Europe; thereafter South Africa functioned as its own administrative province. In 1999, the Province of South Africa became the Province of Southern Africa and covered six countries of Marist presence on the African continent (the others being Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Angola). There are three other Marist Provinces in Africa and one district; there are 24 Provinces and five districts worldwide (depending on the country’s size and number of Brothers). Each Provincial serves a three-year term after being voted in by the Province’s Brothers and appointed by the Superior General in Rome. Br Norbert Mwila, current Provincial, started as a postulant (a trainee Marist Brother) in 1991 in Zambia, and made his final vows in 2000. As Provincial, Br Norbert is responsible for overseeing the running of the Southern African Province (including its schools and other missions) supported by a Council of elected Brothers from the six countries of the Province reporting directly to the Marist Superior General in Rome (currently Brother Emili Turú). The head office of the Province of Southern Africa is located on the Sacred Heart College campus.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>2017 is a significant year for the Marist Brothers. 2017 marks 200 years since the founding of the Marist Brothers by Marcellin Champagnat and the 150th anniversary of the Marists in South Africa. In the lead up to their Bicentenary, the Marists have spent three years focusing on the preparations. 2014/15 was the Montagne year (so named for the dying youth that inspired Champagnat to activate his calling to educational work). The focus was on contemplation around the Marist mission of providing education to those, particularly youth, on the margins of society. 2015/16 was designated the Fouvière year, a reference to the location of where Champagnat and other newly ordained colleagues pledged to start the Society of Mary, in front of a statue of Madonna and Child. This focus on Mary honours her openness to the acceptance of God in life and her role model as mother and nurturer. 2016/17, the La Valla year (named for the village where Champagnat started his first school and training of teaching Brothers) is dedicated to a focus on spirituality and mindfulness.</p>
<p>This logo incorporates the number 200 to signify the Bicentennial year as well as the symbol of the three Marist violets. </p>
