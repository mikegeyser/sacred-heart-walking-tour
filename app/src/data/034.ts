    furtherText: `
    <p>The logo was designed by Kgomotso Mautloa, Matric 2003, Creative Director at Green Robot, a full-service design agency. The representation of the college gates indicates how these are always open to the College’s alumni (hence the use of both the old and new school names above the gate). The alumni association began in 1902 at Koch Street, continued at ‘Obs’ and, has been the community networking hub ever since. Alumni are encouraged to keep in touch with their Alma Mater and with each other, attend reunions or contribute in a variety of ways (e.g. careers talks or mentoring of current learners). The ‘M’ in the centre of the gates links to the words Marist and Meilores (a Latin noun meaning ‘strive for better’ or ‘always better’ and to which Meliora, an adjective and part of the school motto meaning ‘better’ or ‘best’, is related). </p>
<p>Approximately 70,000 Alumni have walked through the gates at Observatory. In the following slides a selection of Alumni are featured, some are mentioned elsewhere in the app, though this does not diminish the stories, contributions and memories of the tens of thousands of other alumni.</p>

    <p>Leo Busschau is remembered for his remarkable marksmanship, a skill he learnt with the Cadets in Koch Street and honed in the military. For many years coached the Cadets at Observatory. In 1937 he was sent a telegram from the King congratulating his winning the King’s Prize at Bisley (a shooting competition); he was afforded a civic reception by the City of Johannesburg and carried through the streets on a chair for all to congratulate his success.  Peter Busschau’s nephew, Jack Busschau, was a learner at Koch Street and Observatory. Jack’s son, Christopher Busschau, first attended Marist College in Port Elizabeth and then St David’s Inanda. Christopher Busschau’s three sons attended St. David’s and his grandson currently does. Christopher Busschau is Treasurer of the alumni association at St David’s. The Busschaus may have the first family alumni connection to the Marist schools in Johannesburg but they are by no means unique in this regard. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>In the November 2013 issue of Meliores, Brian Leong reflected on his families’ association with Sacred Heart College. He recalled watching the long jumpers, with his youngest daughter, at a recent inter-house athletics event and observed Mr Hollingworth taking measurements. It sparked a vivid memory of the same Mr Hollingworth demonstrating discus throwing thirty years before. </p>
<p>Having started at the College in 1974, Brian recalled that ‘whilst many white government schools were going through emergency evacuation drills… Sacred Heart College began admitting pupils of all races…Sacred Heart College provided a haven which allowed me to experience a normal way of growing up in an abnormal society.’ Brian continues to appreciate the diversity of the student (and staff) body that allows his children to learn in an environment that reflects the hope that exists, but isn’t always apparent, in South African society. Brian’s wife, Penny, volunteers her time to facilitate reading and holiday programmes for Three2Six learners, assists with bi-annual retreats for grades 4-6 and chairs the Mindworks Committee, planning the biennial parent-led Primary School learning programme.</p>

    <p>Rebecca, a member of O’Leary house, was academically gifted and, respected by her peers and staff alike, was elected to LLC President in Grade 12. Rebecca, diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Grade 8 underwent chemotherapy for three years. She exceled in her Matric, winning a place at UCT to read Law. During 2013, at UCT, it was discovered that the Leukemia had returned. Rebecca underwent a stem cell and bone marrow transplant, funding for which was part-raised by the wider Sacred Heart Community. Though it appeared that the transplant had been successful, sadly, in 2015 Leukemia was rediscovered in Rebecca’s blood. In May 2015 Rebecca passed away and her funeral was held at Sacred Heart. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>In South Africa Joel Joffe is perhaps best known for having been attorney for Nelson Mandela and the other Rivonia Trialists (apart from James Kantor) in the mid 1960s. Joffe’s role on the Defense Team angered the Apartheid government who then restricted his movement, confiscating his passport. Joffe emigrated to England aided through immigration by Dick Taverne, Chairman of the World Campaign Committee of South African Political Prisoners (WCCSAPP) and British politician. Harold Wolpe, a Rivonia Trialist represented by Joffe, exiled in the UK since escaping from prison in 1963 was a member of WCCSAPP. The above picture, taken in January 2016, shows Joffe (2nd from right) with Ahmed Kathrada and Denis Goldberg (first and second left), both imprisoned after the Rivonia Trial, along with co attorney George Bizos (far right), receiving the Freedom of the City of London received in recognition of their fight for freedom and racial equality. </p>

    <p>An excerpt from Isie Maisels QC’s obituary in The Sunday Times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pre-eminent amongst his generation of advocates, he was one of the country’s most formidable legal minds, as well as a man whose life and interests reflected a deep concern for human rights and civil liberty. He was involved in some of the great court cases of the times, leading the defence of Nelson Mandela and others in the notorious treason trial of 1956                                (Sunday Times 11.12.1994)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly the National Party didn’t raise Maisels to Chief Justice, though he was considered the most deserving candidate by his peers, so after the Treason Trial, Maisels moved to serve in Southern Rhodesia’s High Court, later becoming Chief Justice in Lesotho, Swaziland and Botswana. He returned to Johannesburg to practice law, retiring only a few years before his death. </p>

    <p>In his semi-autobiography ‘A Life at Law’, Isie Maisels reflects on his time at Sacred Heart College where he started, age 7, in Standard 1. Maisels recalled being awarded the Valerian Prize (for the top academic achiever) in his Junior Matric year and how, some twenty-five years later, he met Brother Vital at Yeoville tram station, who remembered Maisels saying that he still recalled misspelling his name, before correcting it, in the awarded prize book.

<p>In a speech given in 2011 at the College Sacred Heart, Tshabalala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will never forget how warmly this school welcomed a young boy from Soweto, how caringly I was nurtured while I was here, and how much Sacred Heart has shaped the man I have become… Sacred Heart has always been well known for producing people who are adept at functioning in multicultural and diverse environments. Long may this continue.”  </p>
