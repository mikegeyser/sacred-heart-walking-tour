    furtherText: `
    <p>The logo was designed by Kgomotso Mautloa, Matric 2003, Creative Director at design agency Green Robot. The representation of the College gates indicates how these are always open to the College’s alumni (hence the use of both the old and new school names above the gate). The alumni association began in 1902 at Koch Street, continued at ‘Obs’, and has been the community networking hub ever since. Alumni are encouraged to keep in touch with their Alma Mater and with each other, attend reunions or contribute in a variety of ways (e.g. careers talks or mentoring of current learners). The ‘M’ in the centre of the gates links to the words Marist and Meliores (a Latin noun meaning ‘strive for better’ or ‘always better’ and to which Meliora, an adjective and part of the school motto meaning ‘better’ or ‘best’, is related). </p>
<p>Approximately 70,000 alumni have walked through the gates at Observatory. In the following slides and elsewhere in the app a number of alumni are featured, but they are a mere fraction of the tens of thousands of other alumni, all with their own stories, contributions and memories.</p>

    <p>Leo Busschau is remembered for his remarkable marksmanship, a skill he learnt with the Cadets in Koch Street and honed in the military. For many years he coached the Cadets at Observatory. In 1937 he was sent a telegram from the King congratulating his winning the King’s Prize at Bisley (a shooting competition); he was afforded a civic reception by the City of Johannesburg and carried through the streets on a chair for all to congratulate his success. Peter Busschau’s nephew, Jack Busschau, was a learner at Koch Street and Observatory. Jack’s son, Christopher Busschau, first attended Marist College in Port Elizabeth and then St David’s Inanda. Christopher Busschau’s three sons attended St. David’s and his grandson currently does. Christopher Busschau is Treasurer of the Alumni Association at St David’s. The Busschaus may have the first family alumni connection to the Marist schools in Johannesburg but they are by no means unique in this regard. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>In the November 2013 issue of Meliores, Brian Leong reflected on his family’s association with Sacred Heart College. He recalled watching the long jumpers with his youngest daughter at a recent inter-house athletics event and observed Mr Hollingworth taking measurements. It sparked a vivid memory of the same Mr Hollingworth demonstrating discus throwing thirty years before. </p>
<p>Having started at the College in 1974, Brian recalled that ‘whilst many white government schools were going through emergency evacuation drills… Sacred Heart College began admitting pupils of all races…Sacred Heart College provided a haven which allowed me to experience a normal way of growing up in an abnormal society.’ Brian continues to appreciate the diversity of the student (and staff) body that allows his children to learn in an environment that reflects the hope that exists, but isn’t always apparent, in South African society. Brian’s wife, Penny, volunteers her time to assist with bi-annual retreats for grades 4-6 and chairs the Mindworks Committee, planning the biennial parent-led Primary School learning programme.</p>

    <p>Rebecca, who was in O’Leary House, was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Grade 8. She had chemotherapy for three years and, whilst in remission, excelled in her Matric. Her peers elected her LLC President for 2012. During 2013, while at UCT reading law, the leukemia returned. Rebecca had a stem cell and bone marrow transplant, funding for which was part raised by the wider Sacred Heart Community. The transplant appeared successful but in 2015 leukemia was rediscovered in Rebecca’s blood. That year Rebecca passed away; her funeral was held at the College.</p>

    <p>In South Africa, Joel Joffe is perhaps best known for having been the Defence Attorney for the Rivonia Trialists, including Mandela, in the mid 1960s. In so doing, Joffe angered the apartheid government, who confiscated his passport to restrict his movement. Joffe emigrated to England aided by British politician, Dick Taverne, Chairman of the World Campaign Committee of South African Political Prisoners (WCCSAPP). There, Joffe joined Harold Wolpe, whom he represented at the Rivonia Trial, exiled in the UK since his escape from prison in 1963. In January 2016, Joffe (2nd from right) along with Ahmed Kathrada and Denis Goldberg (1st and 2nd left, both imprisoned after the Rivonia Trial), and co-attorney George Bizos (far right), received the Freedom of the City of London in recognition of their fight for freedom and racial equality. </p>

    <p>Simpiwe Tshabalala, who was in Benedict House, started Sacred Heart College in Standard 3 (grade 5) in 1978. He was one of the first black children admitted by the school. His matric profile in the 1985 College Yearbook listed Spooks’s (his nickname at school) activities as cricket, rugby, soccer, public speaking, debating, waterpolo and swimming. His ambition, he stated, was the law. Tshabalala went on to study law at Rhodes University.  His yearbook entry ended with a quote; ‘Let me follow them, I am their leader’ (attributed both to Gandhi and French philosopher Ledru-Rollin, a contemporary of Champagnat).  </p>
<p>In the 1990s Sim Tshabalala joined the College’s Board of Governors and in this capacity, in 2000, gave a speech at the College around its identity and direction, alongside Nelson Mandela and Brother Neil. In 2011, again speaking at College whilst encouraging Sacred Heart College learners to become ‘transformers’ of wider society, Tshabalala stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I will never forget how warmly this school welcomed a young boy from Soweto, how caringly I was nurtured while I was here, and how much Sacred Heart has shaped the man I have become… Sacred Heart has always been well known for producing people who are adept at functioning in multicultural and diverse environments. Long may this continue.”  </p>

<p>&quot;Two of the first group of students admitted into the primary school subsequently became well-known business personalities in South Africa. Simpiwe Tshabalala is currently the CEO of Standard Bank, Southern Africa. Molefe Kgomo, the son of Dr Jubilee Kgomo, who with Dr Motlana was in charge of Letsedi Clinic in Soweto at the time, is now a director of a large steel construction business. Dr Kgomo subsequently became a long-serving member of the Governing Body of the College.   With the opening of the 1978 academic year the presence of an increasing number of black students in our schools was noted. This encouraged more applications and admissions. It soon became an issue for the media. The provincial and national authorities also had to respond. There were immediate threats of closure from the Administrator of the Transvaal, at the time, Sybrand van Niekerk.”         Br Neil McGurk, 2015 &quot;                            </p>
