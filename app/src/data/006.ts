    <p>The gate has two entrances – a smaller side entrance for pedestrians and a large one for vehicles and groups, such as the Cadets who would have ‘marched on’ through these gates on their way between the school and the Union or Wanderers Grounds, where they took part in drills. The boys are pictured here with a soccer ball and a bicycle. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Camera Club was run by Brother Rudolf, a keen amateur photographer and the College Science teacher (and Principal, 1965-71). The club used the College darkroom which was situated in the science laboratories to develop their photographs, for of course this was long before the digital era. N. Bartie’s photograph was selected to appear in the 1963 school magazine, then called The Maristonian.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Until then, the gate was a single entry/exit passage but with increased motor traffic in the College this became restrictive. In 1978 a passing truck crashed into the gates, damaging some of the stone work. Brother Anton and Joseph Letebele took the opportunity to construct a double entry/exit gate to ease traffic flow. Each stone was taken down from the original gates and numbered, so that when the new and enlarged gates were built most of the stones could be repurposed in the correct places (e.g. cornerstones were still cornerstones). This was painstaking work, which took most of the year. You can still see the green lettering used to mark each stone on today’s gateposts.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Joseph Letebele also repaired the metal gates after a motorist mistook the closed gates for a side street in the 1990s. A little bend remains today, but straightening it further would necessitate the replacement of the whole gate. As it is, it serves as a reminder to pay close attention while driving in and out. </p>
<p>The College gates were not locked at night until the late 1980s. An incident in 1987 led to this policy being revised. Information in the slides about the Statue of Jesus with the Sacred Heart explains what happened.</p>

The lettering for the signage was prepared by Frank Hollingworth (who has taught High School Science since the late 1970s) in December 1979, as the College reverted to the use of its religious name ‘Sacred Heart College’ when it became co-educational in 1980.",

    <p>Frank Hollingworth recounts how he created these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Brother Neil gave the staff tasks to get us ready for the big day. Mine was to change the &#39;Marist Brothers College&#39; sign above the front gate to &#39;Sacred Heart College&#39;. I was able to use many of the existing letters for this purpose, but had to make C, D, E and A.  I was at a bit of a loss as to how to do this, then had the idea of using the lead pipes which were still sticking out of the wall in the old boarders&#39; boot room (the present-day girls’ toilets next to the IT laboratory). I melted this lead and poured it into moulds which I&#39;d made out of wood, then erected scaffolding under the gate and placed all the letters in the iron frame to spell out the new name. I&#39;ve often looked at the sign will some pride, even though the &#39;D&#39; is a little crooked and I might have made a better job of the &#39;A&#39;. Nevertheless, it is my small &#39;footprint&#39; which will endure for some years to come I hope!&quot;</p>
