The boys are pictured here with a soccer ball and a bicycle. </p>

N.Bartie’s photograph was selected to appear in the school magazine, then called The Maristonian in the 1963 edition.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Until then, the gate was a single entry/exit passage but with increased motor traffic in the College this became restrictive. In 1978 a passing truck crashed into the gates damaging some of the stone work. Brother Anton and Joseph Letebele took the opportunity to construct a double entry/exit gate to ease traffic flow. Each stone was taken down from the original gates and numbered so that when the new and enlarged gates were built; most of the stones could be repurposed in the correct places (e.g. cornerstones were still cornerstones). This was painstaking work which took most of the year. You can still see the green lettering used to mark each stone on today’s gateposts.</p>
