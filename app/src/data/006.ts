The boys are pictured here with a soccer ball and a bicycle. </p>

    <p>This extra-mural was run by Brother Rudolf, a keen amateur photographer and the College Science teacher (and Principal 1965-71).

N.Bartie’s photograph was selected to appear in the school magazine, then called The Maristonian in the 1963 edition.</p>

    <p>Until then, the gate was a single entry/exit passage but with increased motor traffic in the College this became restrictive. In 1978 a passing truck crashed into the gates damaging some of the stone work. Brother Anton and Joseph Letebele took the opportunity to construct a double entry/exit gate to ease traffic flow. Each stone was taken down from the original gates and numbered so that when the new and enlarged gates were built; most of the stones could be repurposed in the correct places (e.g. cornerstones were still cornerstones). This was painstaking work which took most of the year. You can still see the green lettering used to mark each stone on today’s gateposts.</p>

The lettering for the signage was prepared by Frank Hollingworth (who has taught High School Science since the late 1970s) in December 1979 because the College the reverted to the use of its religious name ‘Sacred Heart College’ when it became Co-Educational in 1980.

    <p>Frank Hollingworth recounts how he created these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Brother Neil gave the staff tasks to get us ready for the big day. Mine was to change the &#39;Marist Brothers College&#39; sign above the front gate to &#39;Sacred Heart College&#39;. I was able to use many of the existing letters for this purpose, but had to make C, D, E and A.  I was at a bit of a loss as to how to do this, then had the idea of using the lead pipes which were still sticking out of the wall in the old boarders&#39; boot room (the present-day girls’ toilets next to the IT laboratory). I melted this lead and poured in into moulds which I&#39;d made out of wood, then erected scaffolding under the gate and placed all the letters in the iron frame to spell out the new name. I&#39;ve often looked at the sign will some pride, even though the &#39;D&#39; is a little crooked and I might have made a better job of the &#39;A&#39;. Nevertheless, it is my small &#39;footprint&#39; which will endure for some years to come I hope!&quot;</p>
