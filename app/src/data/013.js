    text: "The statue of Jesus and the Sacred Heart.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>For Christians, particularly Catholics, the Sacred Heart of Jesus symbolises a physical manifestation of God’s divine love for all humanity. Particularly relevant to a Marist school, it echoes Champagnat’s vision of providing education for all children, born out of equal love for them through the way of Mary, mother of Jesus. The school’s slogan is “Education with heart that knows no bounds”.</p>
<p>This photograph shows what the statue, positioned facing the College entrance steps, looks like today. The statue previously stood in two other locations at Sacred Heart College. That the statue is now also painted with colours, unlike most other statues around the school, is also significant. The narratives around these changes are recounted in the following slides. This statue of Jesus does much more than symbolise the College name; it physically links Sacred Heart College to its ongoing mission to uphold its community members’ struggle for peace, equality and justice. </p>

<p>“Only a few days back a beautiful statue of the Sacred-Heart was erected over the entrance of the College. This emblem of the love of God for men is a most befitting image to dominate an institution placed under the patronage and the protection of the Son of God. From its niche it stretches forth its arms in welcome to all those who enter the College.”         (The 1932 Principal’s Report)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is speculation over why the niche was empty for the first few years of the College’s life. Perhaps it was originally intended to contain a statue of Marcellin Champagnat, since in the early days the College was, briefly, called St Benedict’s in his honour. By the early 1930s, though colloquially referred to as Marist ‘Obs’, the school’s name was officially Sacred Heart College and the installation of this statue in this niche was a physical cementing of this fact. Today a copy of the statue of Our Lady of Good Hope sits in the niche. The original statue is kept in the Brothers’ residence.</p>

    <p>The statue of Jesus with the Sacred Heart was moved to its position by the gates in the late 1970s in preparation for the ‘new’ co-educational Sacred Heart College; an amalgamation of the three schools, Marist Observatory, St. Angela’s Convent in Kensington and Holy Family Convent, Yeoville. It symbolically welcomed people to this place of ‘love for all’. Sacred Heart College, the school that would embrace these three groups of learners, had already been named, but the name was not yet widely used by the school or wider community. It was mostly referred to as Marist Observatory to distinguish it from the other Sacred Heart College in Koch Street (the preparatory school for Sacred Heart College from 1926 until 1965), continuing out of habit for more than a decade after Koch Street closed.</p>
<p>The last issue of the Maristonian, published in 1979 (replaced by the Sacred Heart College Yearbook) paid tribute to the Marist Brothers, the Ursuline Sisters and the Holy Family Sisters, now united in Sacred Heart College, under a picture of this statue already situated in its new location just inside the school gates. The statue was only to remain in this spot for about seven years. Events in 1987 necessitated restoration of the statue and resulted in the statue being moved to its current location today. </p>

    <p>Brother Neil McGurk, Principal of the College for 20 years, was responsible for the transformative processes that Sacred Heart College underwent in the 1970s and ‘80s (first with the admittance of black learners in 1976 and then in 1980 with co-education). The College had started to admit Chinese learners from the 1930s and Brother Vincent recalls stories of these boys having to hide in cupboards from visiting government school inspectors, such was the nature of the school even prior to the 1970s. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>This ‘warning’ to black students not to attend school in June 1987 was likely printed and distributed by the security forces, and dropped at Sacred Heart by one Sergeant Beyers. The intention was no doubt to give the impression that black students were behind the necklacing of the Sacred Heart statue and to create discord within the school and Marist community, well known for its inclusivity and racial integration. In some ironic-comic performance, Sergeant Beyers was dispatched to school the next morning when Brother Neil called the authorities to explain what had occurred during the night. </p>
<p>To prevent the charred statue scaring the students (of all races) coming into school, Brother Neil and two colleagues moved the statue whilst his sister Geraldine restored and painted it. The statue was re-erected opposite the main steps in an act of defiance towards those responsible for the necklacing; rather than discarding the burnt statue it was brought physically closer to the school’s heart, demonstrating that ‘love for all’ was the true nature of the College.</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>“What has occurred at Khanya House is a tragedy, not only for the Bishops’ Conference but for the country as well. THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR POLITICAL POINT SCORING. It is a time for all South Africans to realise that violence will not solve the problems of the country.”</p>
<footer>Br Jude Pieterse, Sec. Gen. SACBC 1988</footer>

</blockquote>
<p>It was, in part, the SACBC’s anti-apartheid vision that had inspired the Marists to open Sacred Heart to all races.  Brother Jude relates that further unexploded triggers (including limpet mines) were found in Khanya House. Similar attacks, on Cosatu House (trade union headquarters), and Khotso House (home to the South African Council of Churches and other community organisations), had occurred earlier that year. The apartheid state’s fear of the power of educational and spiritual missions was palpable. The statue of Jesus with Sacred Heart remains a reminder of the transformative potential of that power. </p>
