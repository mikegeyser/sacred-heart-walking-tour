    furtherText: "\n    <p>For Christians, in particular Catholics, the Sacred Heart of Jesus is an extremely important symbol that represents a physical manifestation of God\u2019s divine love for all humanity. This image is particularly relevant to the Marists; linking to Champagnat\u2019s vision of providing education for all children born out of equal love for them through the way of Mary, mother of Jesus.</p>\n<p>The school\u2019s slogan is \u201CEducation with heart that knows no bounds\u201D.</p>\n<p>This photograph, taken in 2016, shows how the statue of Jesus positioned facing the college entrance steps looks today. However, this has not always been the case. The statue previously stood in two other locations at Sacred Heart College and was moved for particular reasons to be explained now. The fact that the statue is now also painted with colours, unlike most of the other statues around the school (with the exception of the Madonna and Child), is also significant. An event in the late 1980s occurred which led to the statue\u2019s repainting and repositioning (further information about this is found in following slides). This statue of Jesus is an object of much more than symbolism around the name of the College \u2013 it is one that physically links Sacred Heart College to its ongoing mission to uphold its community members\u2019 struggle for peace, truth and justice. Without being aware of the particular narrative of the 1980s, teacher Boitumelo Letho, explained that her pupils (in grade 00) are curious about the statue. Several times, when passing the statue on walks around the school with them she has heard snippets of conversations such as these:</p>\n<p>\u201CWow, look it\u2019s Jesus!\u201D \u2026 \u201CNo, it\u2019s not real\u201D \u2026. \u201CBut it is actually where Jesus is buried\u201D \u2026 \u201Cit is like a signpost\u201D \u2026 \u201Cwell I think Nelson Mandela is buried here\u201D \u2026 \u201Cat night maybe they talk to each other\u201D ...</p>\n<p>No matter what their age or whether they know of the narratives relating the statue, this is a focal point for the community of Sacred Heart College.</p>\n\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>The statue of Jesus with the Sacred Heart was moved to this position by the gates in the late 1970s in preparation for the \u2018new\u2019 co-educational Sacred Heart College to open as an amalgamation of the three schools (Marist Observatory, St. Angela\u2019s Convent in Kensington and Holy Family Convent, Yeoville) and symbolically welcomed people to this place of \u2018love for all\u2019. Sacred Heart College, the name of the school in which these three groups of learners would converge was already the name of the school but until that point not widely used by the school or wider community, who preferred to use the name Marist Observatory to distinguish it from the other Sacred Heart College in Koch street (then preparatory school for Sacred Heart College from 1926 until 1965), continuing out of habit for more than a decade after Koch street closed.</p>\n<p>The last issue of the Maristonian, published in1 979 (replaced by the Sacred Heart College yearbook) paid tribute to the Marist Brothers, the Ursuline Sisters and the Holy Family sisters, now united in Sacred Heart College, under a picture of this statue already situated in its new location just inside the school gates.</p>\n<p>The statue was only to remain in this spot for about seven years. Events in 1987 necessitated restoration of the statue and resulted in the statue being moved to its current location today.</p>\n\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>Printed as if a warning to black students not to attend school in June 1897 in solidarity with the events of June 1976 and the student uprising that began the unsettling of the apartheid regime, this leaflet was more likely created to give the impression that black students were behind the necklacing of the Sacred Heart Statue and intended to create discord within the community (both school and Marist) that was known already for its inclusivity and racially mixed make-up and was printed by those connected with and aligned to the governing political body.</p>\n<p>As Brother Neil\u2019s account explains (this can be heard in the previous slide) it was more likely printed and distributed by the (rogue) security forces and personally dropped by one Sergeant Beyers, who as if in some ironic-comic performance, was dispatched to the school the next morning when Brother Neil called the authorities to explain what had occurred at the school during the night.</p>\n<p>The statue of Jesus was removed by Brother Neil and two other colleagues that day for fear of the effects of seeing the post-necklaced might have on the students (both white and black) coming into school. Brother Neil\u2019s sister Geraldine (also responsible for the grotto statue) repainted the statue of Jesus and added the colour to it at that time.</p>\n<p>The re-erection of the statue opposite the main steps was to signify defiance towards those responsible for the necklacing at the time \u2013 rather than discarding the burnt statue, it had been brought literally closer to the heart of the school demonstrating that \u2018love for all\u2019 was the true nature of Sacred Heart College.</p>\n\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>Wilfred Napier, President of the SACBC, in the preface to the booklet described the attack as \u201Can attempt to destroy the commitment and the spirit of justice, love and truth that inspired the Southern African Bishops\u2019 Conference in its opposition to apartheid\u201D.</p>\n<p>Brother Jude related that explosives (including limpet mines) were found in the building after the fire, the planting of which he explained, was most likely intended to extended the damaged caused in the fire.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201CWhat has occurred at Khanya House is a tragedy, not only for the Bishops\u2019 Conference but for the country as well. THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR POLITICAL POINT SCORING. It is a time for all South Africans to realise that violence will not solve the problems of the country. The Bishops\u2019 Conference remains committed to seeking a peaceful solution to the problems of our country\u201D</p>\n<footer>Br Jude Pieterse, Sec. Gen. SACBC 1988</footer>\n\n</blockquote>\n<p>The attack on Khanya House was the third similar of incident that year. Previously that year Cosatu House, the Trade Union Headquarters and Khosto House, the hub for the South African Council of Churches and other community activist organisations had been attacked already.</p>\n<p>Brother Jude, former Marist Provincial, who resided with the Brothers at Observatory but spent much time at Khanya House in his position of Secretary General for SACBC had been actively working towards the desegregation of schools in talks with the then government as Director of the Catholic Institute of Education. The fear of the power of educational and spiritual related missions against the ideals of apartheid regime was palpable. The statue of Jesus with Sacred Heart remains a reminder of the transformative potential of that power.</p>\n\n    ",
