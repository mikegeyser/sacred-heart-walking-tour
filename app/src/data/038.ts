    <p>Amongst items relating to the foundation of the Marist Brothers, such as silver and bronze representations of Champagnat and of his role model, Mary, the mother of Jesus, is a Holy relic of Saint Marcellin. All Marist schools received a similar cabinet in 1999, each with their own relic. The one at Sacred Heart is believed to be from Champagnat’s finger, authenticated by a Latin certificate translated as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We entrust our faith in all those individuals about to inspect these papers and bear witness that we, by virtue of our office, have extracted a particle from the bones of St Marcellin Champagnat from authentic sources and have placed this particle in a round-shaped metal case, protected by unique crystal, bound with a red silk string and signed by our seal in red Spanish wax. We grant into their care these papers signed by our hand and protected by our dry seal.</p>
<footer>Brother Gabriel Andreucci,</footer>

    furtherText: `
    <p>This bell, which came from the third General House (headquarters) of the Marist Brothers, called the Brothers to prayer and meals for over fifty years. The first General House (or Generalate) was at the Brother’s French residence, L’Hermitage de Notre Dame, from 1825. Later it moved to Lyon. When all religious institutes were expelled from France in 1903, the Brothers moved their General House to Grugliasco, northern Italy. In 1958, they moved to Rome. Br Jordan, the Principal of the College during the building of the Memorial Chapel, requested that the bell at Grugliasco be given to the College for its new Chapel. The iron fixtures high up on the wall in the nook between the Chapel and the Macartin Centre mark where it first hung. In recent years, the bell was taken down and hung in the Foyer. </p>
<p>The bell was made of cast iron by the Mazzola Foundry in Valduggia, near Grugliasco. This foundry was run by the Mazzola family since 1475 but closed in 2004. One side of the bell is embossed with ‘Ave Maria’ and an image of Mary. The other side features the Mazzola logo.                                </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Sacred Heart College started a new tradition in 2015. At the beginning of each school year, the bell is moved to the front of the Chapel where the Grade 1s of that year ring the bell to mark the start of their school career. The Matrics of that year ring the bell at their Valedictory Mass to mark the end of their time at Sacred Heart College.</p>
<p>The rope and metal rod used to ring the bell was crafted by Joseph Letebele, as well as the brackets used to fix the bell in the foyer. These are kept in the workshop and brought out when needed.  One of the reasons it was taken down, apart from it being stuck at the back of the chapel out of view, was because it was just too tempting for those walking past not to ring it!</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>This printed fabric wall hanging was given to the College by the Chaplain, Father Dryden. </p>
<p>Hunger cloths, which are produced all over the Christian world, were used first in the Middle Ages as a visual representation of Biblical stories and in so doing to enable an understanding of God before reading was a skill available to all social classes and generations. In many developing countries with a Christian influence, hunger cloths are still created and used for the same purposes, as well as to serve as a reminder of how God relieves the struggles of those in need. </p>
<p>In the Middle Ages these cloths were used to cover altars during Lent (a period of fasting before the feast of Easter) and so referred to as Hunger Cloths. The one that hangs in the Foyer at Sacred Heart is a copy of one that was created by Ethiopian artist Alemayehu Bizuneleh in 1978, and depicts a series of stories from both the Old and New Testaments. The text is in Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Foyer is a space for temporary exhibitions, often of art work by Sacred Heart College or Three2Six learners, and informative displays, including alumni news or materials relating to the critical thinking learning programme. Hanging from the ceiling is a banner that reads ‘good nutrition’, one of many information points set up by High School students as part of a Life Orientation project. </p>
<p>‘Marist Bros. College’ is set into the door’s glass panel in Marist blue and gold. Though the religious name of the school was always Sacred Heart College (which was started as the senior school to the Koch Street Sacred Heart College), it was known colloquially as Marist Brothers’ College, Marist ‘Obs’ (short for Observatory), or simply ‘Obs’ until 1980. When the Main College quadrangle was renovated in the late 1990s, the Foyer entrance to the College was also revamped, funded mainly by the College Tuck shop. The wooden doors were restored to their natural grain and dropped ceilings with cornices and recessed lighting were installed. A light fitting, donated by Alfio Torrisi Architects, added volume to the staircase space. The Fountain was raised during the quad renovations and, at its new height, was now framed in view through the arched doorway of the Foyer.</p>
