    <p>Marist Brothers College, Koch Street served as a hospital during the South African War. Despite the war going on the school remained open, though its pupil numbers were fairly diminished and classrooms were split between school rooms and hospital wards. The hospital, run by the French Red Cross and serviced by Marist Brothers and Sisters from Holy Family (their Convent was at End Street at the time) treated wounded from both sides of the conflict, both Boer and British. The hospital was given protection under the French Tricolore flag and it was at this time that the name Sacred Heart (Sacré Coeur) was appropriated by the school. The emblem of the Sacré Coeur was floated above the school as a flag to denote its neutrality in the war.  </p>

    <p>The Red Cross, established in 1863, is an international organisation that has its headquarters in Geneva. Hence the label given to this photograph. That the school/hospital was under the French arm of the Red Cross is demonstrated by the Tricolour Flag hung on the wall with a picture of the then French President Émile Loubet and the monogram RF (République Française) displayed beneath.</p>

    <p>For the duration of the war (1899-1902) the wounded were brought in daily. The French Red Cross made sure that both the school and the hospital benefited from the arrangement – the Marists were allowed access to precious military rations, a luxury in those times, while the wounded from both sides were treated equally and afforded treatment and respite in comfortable surroundings. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Infirmary (a consulting room with dispensary) and Sanatorium were situated in the upstairs of the block added in 1932 to the school, and is now part of the Marist Provincial offices. Though these rooms were on the same floor as the senior boarders there was no direct access between the two areas and access was gained by a staircase from the ground floor.</p>
<p>The school Matron was a nurse-cum-mother figure for the boys who boarded at Sacred Heart. Though she tended to those who were unwell at any time during the school term, her busiest time of the week was on Saturdays during the rugby season. Several matches a day were played and she was on duty throughout to assist any injured boys (including those from visiting schools).</p>

    <p>There were ten beds available in the Sanatorium for sick boarders who needed to be separated from the rest of the boys in case they spread infectious diseases, or simply needed rest away from the noise of the dormitories. Matron had her own rooms nearby too; in addition to the Sanatorium and Infirmary she had her own private suite, allowing her to stay over if boarders required night time nursing. </p>
<p>Today the school nurse’s rooms are located on the lower ground floor under the Primary School reception office. The former Sanatorium and senior dormitories were readapted for classroom and office use.</p>

    <p>Matron Blow’s daughter-in-law, Beverly Fulton Blow, ballet teacher (until 2016) at Sacred Heart College for 36 years and prior to that for nearly a decade at the Holy Family Convent in Yeoville, remembers coming to fetch her mother-in-law most Saturdays after the sports fixtures had finished. The Blow family would be treated to tea and cake in the Brothers’ Refectory, now the College coffee shop, before Matron Blow would take some respite from her duties at school. Matron’s time off in the week was from Saturday afternoon until Sunday afternoon, when she had to be back in time for the boarders to return to school from their own weekend exeats. </p>
<p>Matron Blow’s great-granddaughter, Astrid Kühn, is, in 2017, a matriculant at Sacred Heart College.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Under the 1978 Nurses’ Act the epaulettes and badges worn by a registered and practicing nurse are protected. By law they must be worn whilst on duty (with a few specified exceptions). Sister Peta-Anne’s maroon epaulette denotes that she is a Registered General Nurse and the bars underneath signify particular capacities in the following areas: community nursing (yellow), psychiatrics (black) and midwifery (green). The lamp within the blue enameled edged badge, the Badge of the South African Nursing Council, alludes to Florence Nightingale, ‘the Lady with the Lamp’, who is considered the creator of modern nursing. </p>
<p>As well as being fully informed of and able to attend to the special medical needs of the learners and staff (for example any existing conditions or allergies that need specific ministrations) Sister Peta-Anne, a  member of staff since 2010, organises staff training for First Aid as part of the Health and Safety Committee and assists support staff to get access to health care. </p>
