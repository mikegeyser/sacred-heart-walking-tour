    <p>The Three2Six Education Project for Refugee Children (Three2Six) is an educational bridging programme for refugee children (ages 6-13) who are unable to access state education in South Africa, for a number of reasons. These can be financial, around language, or discrimination due to structural xenophobia and attitudes towards foreigners, or because previous school records needed for enrolment in state education have been lost or destroyed.</p>
<p>Three2Six operates from 3pm to 6pm in classrooms at Sacred Heart College, Observatory (where the project originated in 2008) and focuses mainly on English, Maths and Life Skills. Reception (Grade R) classes have been held at Observatory Girls Primary since 2010. About 200 children are taught by teachers from the refugee communities, who in turn are supported to convert their teaching experience into local qualifications through UNISA. These teachers are helped by local and international volunteers and by Sacred Heart College learners (and other students) who give of their time after the school day and during holiday periods.</p>
<p>Though education is the main focus of the project, it also creates a feeling of inclusion within South African society for its learners, and provides a safe space for the Three2Six children. The Three2Six Education Project is, in essence, the sixth Marist school in South Africa, for inspired by the mission of Marcellin Champagnat, the ethos is built around inclusion of those most children needy in our society and around the premise that to teach children, one must first love them all and equally.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Three2Six is entirely supported by local and foreign donors, who contribute the running costs (about R9 000 per learner per year). The children who arrive in South Africa as refugees, usually with their families, because they are fleeing war, hostile political or economic situations or other life endangering hardships come from all over the African continent, particularly Francophone countries. </p>
<p>One of the main aims of the project is to place the children, when they are ready, into government schools. The focus of the Three2Six project is therefore on the skills they need to do so. A core focus is reading, writing, comprehension and application of the English language; enabling them to join mainstream education as soon as they are ready to do so. Those who are too far behind when they join (for English is a second, third or even fourth language for most of the children) are given access to a remedial class, which helps them achieve a level of language competency from which they can begin to rejoin their peers.</p>
<p>The lending library, donated by Standard Bank and furnished by the Project’s supporters is therefore a vital part of the strengthening of language skills. In addition, learners are fed daily (you can’t learn when you are hungry), provided with a uniform (in the blue and gold that provides a visible link to the Marist community that Three2Six is part of), and shoes. Stationery and uniform packs are also gifted to the children who leave the project to enter mainstream education.</p>

    <p>The benefits of the Three2Six project are not just for those who receive assistance through the programme. The extended family of Sacred Heart is greatly enriched in many ways through the presence and purpose of the project; sharing facilities is just one small part of it. True concern for social justice and active participation in society is evidenced in Sacred Heart College learners, in no small way influenced by the Marist ethos and the inclusion of the Three2Six project in their community.</p>
<p>Several times a year, such as special Masses, Heritage Day and at some sporting events (such as Inter Catholic Schools Athletics and Soccer tournaments) learners from Three2Six and Sacred Heart College come together to share in activities and learn from each other.</p>
<p>It is not just Sacred Heart learners who feel the impact. A group of Sacred Heart College parents run a food-packing project which contributes monthly food parcels to the families of the children. This was started because in the early days of the project it was noted that some of the children would save their daily provided meal to take home to share with their families. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The holiday programme was first started in 2010 when it was feared that many of the children might be at an extra risk of child trafficking during the Soccer World Cup. The holiday programme was such a success that it has been repeated annually ever since, often twice a year. Some of the activities take place on campus at Sacred Heart College, others involve outings to places of interest such as the Zoo, SciBono and The National Children’s Theatre. </p>
<p>This video clip features part of one such Three2Six holiday project. In 2014, MindBurst Workshop and Minimax Perfoming Arts helped the Three2Six children to write, compose, choreograph, rehearse and perform their own musical theatre production around themes concerning their community. This musical theatre production was nominated for a BASA award in 2015. These awards recognise excellence and innovation in the field of business support for the arts. The content of the musical itself, which was written, choreographed and performed by the children highlighted the sense of identity of the Three2Six community and their situation within the South African context amidst a time beset with resurgences of xenophobic outbursts in local communities. </p>

    <p>During the school holidays, the Three2Six learners are offered programmes in the arts, sciences, computing, sports and other skills that the daily timetabling focus on numeracy and literacy cannot afford. </p>
<p>The learner shown holding his artwork (in the image above) participated in the 2015 holiday programme “Journey with an Artist”. This was a four-day creative and critical thinking skills workshop, facilitated by MindBurst Workshop in conjunction with Three2Six and Sacred Heart College, that equipped the children with an understanding of their rights as children in South Africa, whilst providing space for creative expression around their sense of self and aspirations. Here he tells the story behind his art work which he titled “The Hero”.  </p>

    <p>Three2Six learners from Grades 5 and 6 took part in a Sports Challenge that included coaching in soccer and netball followed by matches one Saturday in June 2016. This event, sponsored by Kaya FM and hosted by Sacred Heart College, was designed to not only provide a focus for sports training that has increasingly become a regular fixture for the Three2Six learners when time at weekends and during holidays allows, but to teach the fundamentals of working as a team. That the refugee children were playing against a team from the township of Tembisa was intentional; the idea being to enhance relations between the refugee communities that the Three2Six children come from and those of South Africans living in Johannesburg, and to bring contact between communities that have historically undergone xenophobic clashes. Dolphins is the sports emblem for all Sacred Heart College teams, not least the newly established Three2Six sports teams.</p>

    <p>The Three2Six Children’s Refugee Education Project, a Sacred Heart College initiated Marist project, operates at Sacred Heart College, Observatory Girls Primary and, since 2016, at Holy Family Convent in Parktown. Learners and teachers from the refugee communities (mainly in Hillbrow, Berea, Yeoville and the surrounding areas) use the classrooms and facilities in these premises after regular school hours. But, as explained, the communities of learners are intertwined in many more ways than just by using the same spaces. Three2Six is the sixth Marist school in South Africa today. The logo on the learner’s shirt above (red for the Holy Family location, blue for Sacred Heart, but with the same logo, underscored with Holy Family College and Sacred Heart College respectively) incorporates the Marist monogram in the African continent and uses the blue and gold colours of the Marist schools. The gold bands, coming from all over Africa on this logo, represent the paths of the migrating children and families joining in Johannesburg, finding refuge in the Marist community.</p>
