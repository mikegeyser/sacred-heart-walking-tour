    <p>The Three2Six Children’s Refugee Education Project (Three2Six) is an educational bridging program for refugee children (ages 6-13) who are unable to access state education in South Africa for a number of reasons. These can be financial, around language, or discrimination due to structural xenophobia and attitudes towards foreigners and loss of previous school records needed for enrolment in state education.</p>
<p>Three2Six operates from 3pm to 6pm in classrooms at Sacred Heart College, Observatory (who initiated the project in 2008) and focuses mainly on English, Maths and Life Skills. Reception (Grade R) classes have been held at Observatory Girls Primary since 2010, also funded by the Sacred Heart College Three2Six not-for-profit foundation. About 200 children are taught by teachers from the refugee communities who in turn are supported to convert their teaching experience into local qualifications through UNISA. These teachers are helped by local and international volunteers and by Sacred Heart College learners (and other students) who give of their time after the school day and during holiday periods.</p>
<p>Though education is a main focus of the project, a feeling of inclusion within South African society for its learners and providing a safe space for the Three2Six children to be is integral to the ethos of the project. The Three2Six Children’s Refugee Education Project is the sixth Marist school in South Africa, for inspired by the mission of Marcellin Champagnat, the ethos is built around inclusion of those most children needy in our society and around the premise that to teach children, one must first love them all and equally.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Three2Six is entirely supported by donors (individuals and businesses in South Africa and overseas) who contribute the running costs (about R9 000 per learner per year). The children who have arrived as refugees, usually with their families, in South Africa because they are fleeing war, hostile political or economic situations or other life endangering hardships come from all over the African continent, particularly Francophone countries. </p>
<p>Because mastering English is imperative in being able to access mainstream education after the Three2Six program the focus of the learners is on gaining this skill. By the time the children have completed their learning program they are competent in reading, writing, comprehension and application of the English language; enabling them to join mainstream education at High School level or earlier if they are ready. For those who are too far behind when they join, for English is a second, third or even fourth language for most of the children, they are given access to a remedial class which helps them achieve a level of language competency from which they can begin to rejoin their peers.</p>
<p>The lending library, donated by Standard Bank and furnished by the Project’s supporters is therefore a vital part of the strengthening of language skills. In addition, learners are fed daily (you can’t learn when you are hungry), provided with a uniform (in the blue and gold provides a visible link to the Marist community to which Three2Six is a fundamental part of) and shoes. Stationary and Uniform packs are also gifted to the children when they move on to begin mainstream education when they finish with the Three2Six program.</p>

    <p>The benefits of the Three2Six project are not just for those who receive assistance through the program. The extended family of Sacred Heart is greatly enriched in many ways through the presence and purpose of the project; sharing facilities is just one small part of it. True concern for social justice and active participation in society is evidenced in Sacred Heart College Learners and in no small way influenced by the Marist ethos and the inclusion of the Three2Six project in their community.</p>
<p>Several times a year, such as Sacred Heart Day, Heritage Day and some sporting events (such as the Inter Catholic Schools Athletics Event) learners from Three2Six and Sacred Heart College come together to share in activities and learn from each other.</p>
<p>It is not just on the learners that this impact is made. The Sacred Heart College parents began and co-ordinate a food-packing project which contributing monthly food parcels to the families of the children. This was started because in the early days of the project it was noted that some of the children would save their daily provided meal to take home to share with their families. </p>

    <p>In addition to the language, literacy and numeracy skills that are taught, the children are also given life skills in the usual school week. During the school holidays, they are offered arts, science, computing, sports and other skills that the daily timetabling focus on numeracy and literacy cannot afford. During the year the Three2Six children are also invited to participate in activities with the children at Sacred Heart College such as special Masses and in sporting events like athletics and soccer.</p>
<p>The holiday program was first started in 2010 when it was feared that during the Soccer World Cup, many of the children might be at an extra risk of child trafficking. The holiday program was such a success that it has been repeated annually ever since, often twice a year. Some of the activities take place on campus at Sacred Heart College, others involve outings to places of interest such as the Zoo, SciBono and The National Children’s Theatre. </p>
<p>The learner shown holding his artwork participated in the 2015 holiday programme “Journey with an Artist” which was a four-day creative and critical thinking skills workshop, facilitated by MindBurst Workshop in conjunction with Three2Six and Sacred Heart College, that equipped the children with an understanding of their rights as children in South Africa whilst providing space for creative expression around their sense of self and aspirations. Here one boy tells the story behind his art work which he titled “The Hero”.  </p>

    <p>This photograph, from the archive of Museum Africa, shows Sacred Heart College pupils handing over gifts that had been collected for a relief-fund in 1932. In 1932 there was world wide economic depression and South Africa was not excepted from suffering the effects of this. It is not certain for which disaster relief fund these gifts were donated though Wolf Hillman and G.M Newton were Rotary Club members at the time and perhaps managers of their relief fund. A connection between the Rotary Club and Sacred Heart College remains to this day in joint efforts for charitable works.</p>
<p>What is clear though is the continuity of the generosity of the Sacred Heart College Community. </p>

    <p>As well as supporting the Three2Six Education Project through a number of events, the school community regularly collects for and donates to other causes. Charitable giving is regularly forthcoming, beginning with those in the Pre-Primary who are encouraged to share weekly on Piggy-Money days and through specially organised events such as dressing up days where monetary or other donations are encouraged throughout the whole school that support local and national charities. Recent examples from 2016 include the donation of hundreds of litres of bottled water by pupils in the High School during the droughts and their assistance of the Rotary Club of SA in the Stop Hunger food packing drive. Pupils from the Three2Six, PrePrimary and Primary were also involved in the creation of artwork for the new Nelson Mandela Children’s Hospital which demonstrates another way in which the community gives to its wider setting. </p>
