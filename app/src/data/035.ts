    <p>The Main Quad with its Fountain was completed when the school in Observatory opened its doors to pupils in 1926. This space, with its central water feature, is one of the oldest spaces in the College. It has always been a place for morning assemblies, though originally the whole school met here to pray and listen to notices (note the younger boys visible at the front of this image). However, there would have been about 500 learners at the College in the mid 1940s, now there more than twice as many, so morning assemblies are split between the three quads for the different learning phases (Foundation and Intermediate Phases and High School). </p>
<p>The Fountain is just about visible in the midst of the assembled boys. A notable difference is the small balcony that can be seen to the right of the picture; today this balcony has been enlarged and the upstairs room it is accessed off turned into bathrooms for College visitors and staff. Also note how there is no verandah style walkway on the western edge of the Quad at this stage – this was only added in 1997. </p>

    <p>The direction that learners face for assembly is the same today as it has been for years. Daily assemblies take place in the Quads and these gatherings last around ten minutes. This is also the point at which attendance and latecomers are noted. However, since 1992 a decision was taken to return to the more formal assemblies which were found pictured in the archive dating from the 1920s and 1930s, which gathered sections of the school in the hall for a more instructive and reflective session. Today the High School has assembly in the Hall on Wednesday mornings, while the Foundation and Intermediate Phases use the Chapel for hymn practice once a week.</p>

    <p>When the Main Quad was constructed it was built perfectly flat but, because of this, the space often became flooded during heavy rains. Hence it was joked that the Quad was modelled on Piazza San Marco in Venice (which sits just above sea level and for centuries has flooded when the tides are high). Of course this wasn’t practical for a College meeting place and thoroughfare and so in 1997 the Quad was renovated. This was mainly financed by the College tuck shop and facilitated by the College Development Fund. The renovations to the Quad also included covering the western walkways, and necessitated a revamp of the College’s Foyer with adaptations to the sweeping staircase area, including Italianate recessed lighting and cornices on the inside and an extension to the balcony overhanging the Quad. That the style was Italian in theme was perhaps a nod to the Venetian in-joke. The two trees that graced the original Quad were replaced with Fever trees in the planters, donated by Moreland Developments with their special irrigation system donated by the 1996 matrics. </p>

    <p>Leavers from the High School and Primary School senior years traditionally club together and leave a lasting addition to the College facilities. Some of these have included trees and planters in the Foundation Quad, benches and tables in the Intermediate Quad and other furnishings around the grounds. The mosaics inset to the circular brick platforms in the Quad and adorning the archway tunnel that leads towards the sports fields were created by High School learners during the 2010 Sacred Arts Festival. </p>
<p>It was inside this archway, in 1998, that President Mandela contributed his signature to a mural created by the SRC. Unfortunately, a miscommunication led to this being painted over!</p>

    <p>Before the High School Quad was remodelled in the 1990s the Fountain was more accessible, set at a lower level than it is now. There are still fish in the Fountain pond today, lovingly looked after by Janet Balchin, the ‘tuck shop lady’. At rare moments of quiet, birds still visit to drink. The 1942 Maristonian tells of pigeons and Indian Mynahs that used to bathe in the fountain and were fed by the pupils.</p>
<p>Though dogs are not allowed on the school grounds, there have always been ‘College dogs’. Notably, the late Br Paul’s Alsatian Guide Dogs Sheena and her successor Suzy were a feature of College life for the thirty years that he was a resident Brother. Br Martin’s Fox Terrier Snoopy was regularly found waiting in line for a sausage from the tuck shop at first break. During the 1980s an Alsatian called Freddy used to follow a learner, Martin, each morning as he walked from Yeoville to College. According to teacher Frank Hollingworth, Freddy was welcomed into several of Martin’s classes and was considered an honorary Sacred Heart College member. Today Bella (School Counsellor Marie Grobler’s Cocker Spaniel) and Teddy (Frank Hollingworth’s Jack Russell) are a familiar presence at school. </p>

    <p>The Fountain continues to be a place of fascination and focus for Sacred Heart College community members, from the Pre-School, who come to see the fish and who draw the Fountain in their art sessions (likely not for the last time during their school careers), to past pupils and staff members who find the feature evokes memories of their times at the school. A search of the alumni Facebook page reveals several posts that recall this spot as meaningful and central to their recollections of time spent at the College. When it is extremely cold in the winter, icicles hang over the edges of the stone circles and sometimes even form on the nearby plants set into the concrete circular planters at the four corners of the raised Fountain surround.  </p>
