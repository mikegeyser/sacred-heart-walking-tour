    <p>The Senior Primary Quad – or Intermediate Quad (Intermediate Phase is grades 4-6) was officially opened in the centenary year of the Marist Brothers arrival in Johannesburg, in March 1989. The foundation stone was unveiled by Mr K. O’Dowd, Chairman of Anglo American’s Chairman’s Fund, one of the main contributors to the funding of the new premises along with the De Beers Chairman’s Fund and the JCI Fund. The relationship between the sponsors and the school came through shared insights around educational development and provision at a national level. The Marist Brothers, College staff and wider community members together with representatives from these corporations held talks with the Department of Education that led to reinvestment in schooling, both in private schools like Sacred Heart College and in Model C and D schools in central Johannesburg in the late 1980s and early 1990s; a period of critical change.</p>
<p>At the time that the Senior Primary building was opened the school implemented an innovative curriculum of Integrated Studies for those in the bridging years of Primary and High school (grades 7 and 8). This was a consolidation of subject teaching, particularly in the social sciences, which provided a common focus on literacy, numeracy and language learning. It was a skills based and differentiated approach to accommodate learners from different educational and language backgrounds enabling them to learn together with those who had already benefited from Sacred Heart’s learning environment. The subject matter provided a balanced historical perspective and was taught in relation to real life experiences that encouraged interaction amongst the diverse student body. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>All over the College grounds, in windows, on plaques, in the form of benches, artworks or dedicated spaces there are memorials to those members of the school community who have died. Many more of course are recalled through the memories of those who have attended or still attend the college without a physical marker in the grounds to their earthly existence. Each one, in their own way, made a special contribution to the family spirit of Sacred Heart College. </p>
<p>This stained-glass window, created by artist Barry Thompson, who produced most of the windows in the Memorial Chapel, commemorates the life of Bebe Mothopeng 1982-2004. Bebe, a member of the Learners Leadership Council, matriculated from the College in 2001.  She was in the third year of her Bachelor of Education degree at UNISA, completing her teaching practice at Sacred Heart College, when she died in 2004 after a short illness. Like many members of her family, Bebe was a musician and had been a member of both the Soweto Youth Orchestra and the Johannesburg Youth Orchestra as a wind instrumentalist and sang as part of the Nightingale Children’s Choir in her youth. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>In the final school assembly of 1993 and when the learners were housed in the classrooms on the Observatory site (having moved the Junior Primary learners from Yeoville in 1993), a prayer for peace was said by the whole school. It was said because It was a time of national uncertainty in the run up to the first democratically held elections in the country in 1994 (rather than in anticipation of unrest in the school after the addition of junior classes).  This whole school prayer for peace was written about by a visiting German journalist who described the spirit of the diverse and united school community as a way in which future hope for the country could be developed. This magazine article was read by the Director of the Peace Pole Project (an international organization that began in Japan in the 1950s) who decided that Sacred Heart would be a fitting location for a South African Peace Pole to be erected – one that attempts to remind onlookers of the importance of peace in a location that has suffered disruption through human injustices.  </p>
<p>From 1994, after an elaborate ceremony which involved the whole school and members of the wider community, a peace pole was put up to the right of the stage area. On its four sides it reads “May Peace Prevail On Earth” in isiZulu, Afrikaans, Sesotho and English to remind its observers of the message it stands for. After the quad was renovated some years later the pole was removed from its spot, and is now kept in the workshop. One might guess that it has not been re-installed because the message of tolerance, unity and diversity has long been learnt at Sacred Heart. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Integrated Studies Curriculum was a concrete example of the innovative approach to education undertaken at Sacred Heart College. The school is underpinned by and strengthened through values that come directly from the unique application of Marcellin Champagnat’s educational vision and which lie at the core of Marist schools. These values can be understood as five pedagogical (or educational practice) pillars that uphold and inform the educational framework of the school. These five characteristics are named as presence, simplicity, family spirit, love of work and following the way of Mary. </p>
<p>Mary, the mother of Jesus, is understood as the perfect model of the Marist educator. Faithful and loving she knew both the joys and the trials of life. In her way, Marist educators seek to lead by example and above all to encourage the personal growth of their learners by establishing relationships with them based on love and humility. The family spirit that is encouraged is evidenced in the relationships built between learners of all ages, supported by their teachers, through whom a strong community is built. This simple, modest attentiveness is something which sets apart the Marist and Sacred Heart Community from others – the nurturing of ‘doing good, quietly’ in a school setting encourages hard work, application and mindfulness.  </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>This photograph, from the archive of Museum Africa, shows Sacred Heart College learners handing over gifts that had been collected for a relief-fund in 1932 during the worldwide economic depression, which also affected South Africa. A connection between the Rotary Club and Sacred Heart College remains to this day in joint efforts for charitable works. In 2016, the Rotary Club’s “Stop Hunger” food packing drive was assisted by High School learners and staff. </p>
<p>The five Marist pillars include presence, love of work and family spirit. These characteristics are seen in many ways within the school community (e.g. the whole school supporting of the Three2Six education project) but also in connection with wider community projects. That charitable work is more than just a donation but involves presence, application (and fun!) can be seen in a number of projects that the children take part in like the yearly Red and White Days and Rollerblade Disco which raises funds for a local children’s home, or the collection of bottled water for national distribution during the droughts of 2015/2016.</p>

    <p>Pupils from three sections of the school (Three2Six, Pre-Primary and Primary) were involved in the creation of artwork for the Hospital that opened in late 2016. Charitable giving and works are an important part of the College’s community spirit. In the Pre-Primary weekly collections of extra packed lunches donated by families are passed onto a ‘meals on wheels’ service for the elderly and homeless. Older learners are encouraged to think of their own causes and ways in which to support them; examples of these are the pupil-led initiative by grade 5s in 2016 to hold their own ‘CEO SleepOut’ to raise funds for the destitute and the High School’s Enviro-Club and Eco Committee, which, in 2016 was awarded International Green Flag Status by Generation Earth (a US based environmental education program). </p>
