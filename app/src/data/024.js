The Sodality was a society for Catholic boys who wished to grow in faith through dedication to Mary, the Mother of Jesus. As well as prayer meetings and fellowship the society was responsible, from the level of the boys (rather than through religious instruction, Catechism and Mass led by the Brothers), for inspiring Catholic spirit in the College and for charitable works contributing to the wider community.",
    furtherText: "\n    <p>The first Sodality began at Koch Street in the late 1880s and soon to split into a junior and senior section due to its popularity amongst the boys. When the Senior boys moved to Observatory in 1926, their Sodality moved too. The full title of the Sodality was The Sodality of the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady of Perpetual Succour. By the 1960s the group had become known more colloquially as The Sodality of Our Lady. With the advent of co-education, the Sodality was disbanded at the College to allow for the creation of more inclusive charitable and/or faith led societies. </p>\n\n    ",

In times gone by sailors used the stars as guidance and for the Sodality, formed in the name of Our Lady, this star would have signified Mary\u2019s guidance in their works. Of course, being a Marist Sodality, the relevance of working in the way of and protection by Mary is of great significance.</p>\n\n    ",

In the 1960s the Science Laboratory moved to the \u2018Manual Training Hall\u2019 (later hugely modified to become the Brothers\u2019 Residence), until then used for nationwide compulsory wood/metalwork classes. Brother Raymond, known by the boys as \u201CCossack\u201D taught Maths, Science and Latin, was for some time College Principal and later Marist Provincial. Brother Raymond, who along with Brothers Neil and Rudolph, championed the building of a new science block died before its completion in 1973. The latter two Brothers secured funding from Anglo-American to build the new block (and furnish with top of the range \u2018Leybold\u2019 apparatus). </p>\n<figure><img src=\"assets/images/points-of-interest/12.24.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption>The Manual Training Hall c1960 (Image: Marist Archive)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n    ",

Spitz, in 1937 to mark the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps this is the pine tree that still stands at the southern end of the Science block; a photograph in the 1937 Maristonian suggests this might be the case.</p>\n\n    ",

His specialism is Physical Sciences and many of his pupils have gone onto illustrious careers in the Sciences such as Professor Bruce Watson, matric 1984 (Spectral Theory Expert, Wits University), Dr Ridwan Mia, matric 1993 (award winning plastic surgeon) and Dr David Balchin, matric 2005 (Postdoctoral Fellow at Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry). Until the mid 1980s he coached the 1st XV Rugby and 1st XI Cricket teams and today runs the Sacred Heart College Chess team and clubs. </p>\n<p>As well as his professional interest in Science, Frank is a keen amateur historian and assisted Brother Martin for years compiling the digital section of the Marist Archive.

Colin Northmore, who\u2019d not long become College Principal, suggested restorative justice to the culprit (who had immediately come forward) and a new sapling was bought. Unfortunately, the stump of the burnt tree proved impossible to remove. Shortly after the incident, Mr. Northmore was visited by a group of the learner\u2019s peers in his office. They were so distraught at the loss of the tree, which had burst into flames because of the Cypress\u2019 highly flammable resin, that they suggested further punishment was necessary. The aforementioned learner removed the graffiti that had become an eye-sore in the boys\u2019 bathrooms and latterly developed a keen interest in gardening. </p>\n\n    ",
