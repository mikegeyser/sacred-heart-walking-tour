    <p>The open veld of Observatory provided the Brothers with the opportunity to not only build a new school but to create expansive playing fields for sports that would have been impossible in the residential suburb of Doornfontein. The purchase of 32 acres on Observatory Ridge meant that the sporting reputation of Sacred Heart College, Koch Street could be maintained and, as history proved, built upon. An article in The Star published in 1965 described the Koch Street school as “a famous sporting nursery” and a “soccer stronghold…[that]… over the years, athletes, cricketers, rugby internationals and tennis players owed both their own greatness, and the splendour they gave to South African sport, to their training at Marists.”</p>
<p>The top field was levelled during the late 1920s as it was a rocky waste land. During the 1960s, the fields were given their two-tiered layout. Soil, excavated from Rosebank while building the Mall, was used to raise the topmost fields and thereby create a sunken cricket oval. </p>
<p>Several sports have fallen out of the curriculum at the College over the years, for a variety of different reasons, and other sports have been added as time goes on. </p>

    <p>Boxing was a very popular sport until the late 1950s. A ring, donated in the 1930s by the S.A.N.A.B.A (South African National Amateur Boxing Association), was set up in the Hall for practices and for years Sacred Heart College was the only school in Johannesburg with an actual ring. The boys took part in tournaments against pugilists from other schools and against each other – from the mid 1940s the Boarders vs. Day Boys boxing tournament was an annual calendar highlight. The boxing ring was even set up in the Main Quad for the annual school championships since the sport was popular with spectators, and the crowd drawn to the event was too large to fit in the Hall. </p>

    <p>The lightweight school Boxers were known as the College Midgets with the Mighty Midgets (or Marist Midgets) the title going to the Senior or Heavyweight boys. The College boxing trainer and manager for several decades was Jack O’Malley. Des Williams, who represented South Africa in the 1948 Olympic Games as a flyweight, was one of O’Malley’s first trainees. Indeed, the 1965 Maristonian lists eight alumni as having represented the country in boxing with one (J. Watson) becoming South African Boxing coach. Stan Silcock also learnt boxing under Jack O’Malley and later became Headmaster of Marian College, Linmeyer. </p>

    <p>Rugby was played at Koch Street until a few years before WW1. A Koch Street team won the 1899 Transvaal Rugby Junior Cup, captained by Woodburn MacCowat (who later played for Scotland), against Pirates. Then the boys played Rugby League code (13 players per team). But the Brothers College chose to concentrate on soccer so rugby was ‘discontinued’. Writing in the 1912 Maristonian, Clarence Becker (a Koch Street alumnus), later national selector for the S.A Rugby Association, took the Brothers to task for having &quot;cold-shouldered&quot; rugby. Brother Valerian, then Principal, explained that &quot; rugger will always be a risky game . . . There is no gainsaying that rugger is a grand game . . . but where small and big boys are so mixed up in the classes . . . we cannot be convinced that rugger is a better game for growing lads than soccer . . .” </p>
<p>Rugby was reintroduced to Sacred Heart College in 1934 as the official winter sport, in line with the Transvaal schools’ sports policy. The Transvaal Rugby Union grassed the old soccer pitches and the school adopted the Rugby Union code (playing with 15 players). The boys were coached by professionals and the Brothers. In 1949 the New Zealand All Blacks (whose team had nine Marist Old Boys) visited the College and presented the 1st XV with an inscribed ball. More than the equivalent of a whole rugby team of Springbok players were introduced to the sport at Sacred Heart, including Syd Nomis, who until 2001 held the record for most consecutive games (25) played for the Springboks.</p>

    <p>Rugby was popular with the boys and an important feature of College life for years – games drew large crowds with major opponents being St. David’s Inanda, Jeppe Boys’ High School, Parktown Boys and K.E.S. However, no match was more popular than the annual Boarders v. Day Boys fixture (providing the boys with an opportunity to create their own traditions, e.g. junior boys rolling out red carpets for the senior players), which set the tone of the spirit of the school at the time. Brother Mario remembers the rugby games in the ‘60s and ‘70s being more like clashes than matches and the War Cry being belted out with more than just volume. </p>
<p>Rugby was played at the school until 1986, when the sport was re-replaced by soccer. There were several reasons for this; the admission of black students in the 1970s embodied the College’s distancing from the apartheid government’s elitist policies; for many, rugby symbolised these colonial hangovers. With the school now co-educational, the hubristic and ‘putting-on-a-pedestal’ tendencies that the sport engendered were no longer appropriate. Many of the boys at the school were also inspired to play soccer by teacher Mickey Lill, a former English Premier League player. The tragic death of alumnus Jeffrey Ho on the field, playing for an Old Boys’ team in 1984, hastened the end of rugby, though this had been coming for some years. A plaque dedicated to the memory of Jeffrey Ho can be found set into the wall by the steps that lead up to the former rugby pitches (now the First Soccer field), directly east of the Science Block.</p>

    <p>Many curriculum and club sports have been and gone at Sacred Heart College. Reasons for this include differing levels of interest at different times by the boys – sports can go in and out of ‘fashion’ and specialist teachers come and go. Fencing, judo and baseball are examples of this tendency. Better known for its rugby club today, Pirates started a baseball league when many Americans arrived to join the mining camps in the late 1880s. In the 1950s it was baseball that carried the Pirates’ reputation around South Africa – not rugby. Sacred Heart College had its own team that participated in its tournaments. </p>

    <p>Physical Training (and Physical Education today) at Sacred Heart College contributed to the fitness and skill sets of those who entered sporting careers outside of school hours. Many alumni have gone on to represent South Africa in their own particular field. These sports include Judo, golf, billiards, shooting, body building, equestrian eventing, weightlifting, wrestling, gymnastics and softball.</p>
