Their skills range from carpentry to welding, from tiling to landscaping, and from catering provision to security monitoring and as individuals are integral to the College community. ",

    <p>The College Workshop is situated in the building where the Boarders’ Laundry and Ironing used to be done. The Workshop was originally in the northern basement of the main College building (where the printing room and school Nurse can be found) but the noise of the machinery in use during class time meant that an alternative space was necessary. When a Laundry for the Boarders was no longer required the Workshop was moved from the basement to the Laundry building.  </p>

    <p>Gratitude to the Maintenance and Support staff is shown in a variety of ways by other members of the College community – Thank you Breakfasts and Masses are two examples. The relations between the non-teaching staff and the learners are genuinely reciprocal. The support staff are often included by learners who bring baked goods to share with their peers and teachers on their birthdays. The ground staff are often present at College sports matches and, when they can, assist children in accessing items mistakenly left behind after hours. </p>

The College has two boreholes on the property, one of which dates to the 1920s when the grounds were prepared for use as a school and is located within the Workshop building itself. Only the pump has been replaced since but the hole remains a plentiful source of water up to now. Water from the two boreholes (the second is located on the top field) is combined with a municipal supply in this tower tank.",

    <p>The image of the tower was taken before the Main Quadrangle was renovated in the late 1990s. The piazza of the quadrangle was liable to flooding in heavy rains; the after effects of this can be seen in the lower right hand corner of the image. </p>

    <p>Joseph Letebele trained in carpentry at Pax College (Pietersburg) with the Brothers of Charity. His first contact with Sacred Heart College, or Marist Obs as it was known then, was through his father Ephraim Letebele, Boarders’ Chef from 1934 (until his retirement in 1974). Joseph had a holiday job in July 1959 and was invited back for a probationary period as a handyman in 1961. From 1962, as recorded in this Dompas above, he was permanently employed, as school Carpenter and “proved to be quite indispensable. He knows where every fuse is to be found, where every key fits, the intricacies of the swimming pool filter, the condition of every desk… the list is endless” (1989 College Yearbook).</p>

Currently he is refurbishing the desks and chairs in the Primary School. Each desk and chair he makes by hand including the metal welding and soldering. He has also produced furnishings for St David’s College, Inanda and St. Joseph’s College, Rondebosch. </p>
