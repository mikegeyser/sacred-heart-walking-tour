    <p>Almost everyone connected to Sacred Heart College during the 1990s/2000s has their own recollections of Nelson Mandela’s frequent visits to the College. To include all the stories would be impossible; a few selected for the following slides give some insight into the special relationship that Nelson Mandela, his family and that of Sacred Heart College have had over the years.</p>
<p>Some of the visits the President made were in an official capacity (for example when he took the lead in fundraising events for bursary schemes, new buildings or renovations), others more personal (parent’s evenings and watching his grandchildren in school productions). Visits were impromptu (such as his attendance at the 2001 Family Fun day on 16th June much to the consternation of his security team), others planned. Even the scheduled events caused a stir for his team; Frank Hollingworth recalled the attendance of Mandela at the Bugsy Malone school production. One scene required cast members to burst into the hall brandishing weapons to the sound of something similar to gun fire. Mandela’s protection team jumped up and prepared to react, much to the amusement of the cast, audience and President who had already assessed that high school students furnished with custard guns were not likely to be a national security threat. </p>

    <p>Artist Willem Boshoff on Mandela:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For some years now my children attended the same school as Mr. Mandela&#39;s grandchildren, Sacred Heart College in Observatory, Johannesburg. We regularly see him at school plays and other functions. He surprised all of us with his lack of bitterness after his four neves* sentences and with his astute and accommodating leadership. However, what impressed me most about him is that, in spite of staggering commitments of national and international dimension, in spite of (perhaps it is because of) the many years of life missed while we [sic.] was in jail, he affords his (rather naughty) grandchildren the time and respect one might prudently bestow upon royalty, presidents and the like.”<br>  <a href="http://www.davidkrut.com/bioBoshoff.html">http://www.davidkrut.com/bioBoshoff.html</a> </p>
