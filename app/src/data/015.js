    furtherText: "\n    <p>The Senior Primary Quad \u2013 or Intermediate Quad (the Intermediate Phase being grades 4-6) was officially opened in the centenary year of the Marist Brothers arrival in Johannesburg, in March 1989. The foundation stone was unveiled by Mr K. O\u2019Dowd, Chairman of Anglo American\u2019s Chairman\u2019s Fund, one of the main contributors to the funding of the new premises. Other sponsors were the De Beers Chairman\u2019s Fund and the JCI Fund The relationship between the sponsors and the school came through shared insights around educational development and provision at a national level. The Marist Brothers, College staff and other community members together with representatives from these corporations held talks with the Department of Education that led to reinvestment in schooling, both in private schools like Sacred Heart College and in Model C and D schools in central Johannesburg in the late 1980s and early 1990s; a period of critical change.</p>\n<p>At the time that the Senior Primary building was opened the school had implemented an innovative curriculum; that of integrated studies for those in the bridging years of Primary and High school (grades 7 and 8). This was a consolidation of subject teaching, particularly in the social sciences, which provided a common focus on literacy, numeracy and language learning. It was a skills based and differentiated approach to accommodate learners from different educational and language backgrounds enabling them to learn together with those who had already benefited from Sacred Heart\u2019s learning environment. The subject matter provided a balanced historical perspective and was taught in relation to real life experiences that encouraged interaction amongst the diverse student body. </p>\n\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>The Integrated Studies Curriculum was a concrete example of the innovative approach to education undertaken at Sacred Heart College. The school is underpinned by and strengthened through values that come directly from the unique application of Marcellin Champagnat\u2019s educational vision and which lie at the core of Marist schools. These values can be understood as five pedagogical (or educational practice) pillars that uphold and inform the educational framework of the school. These five characteristics are named as presence, simplicity, family spirit, love of work and following the way of Mary. </p>\n<p>Mary, the mother of Jesus, is understood as the perfect model of the Marist educator. Faithful and loving she knew both the joys and the trials of life. In her way, Marist educators seek to lead by example and above all to encourage the personal growth of their learners by establishing relationships with them based on love and humility. The family spirit that is encouraged is evidenced in the relationships built between learners of all ages, supported by their teachers, through whom a strong community is built. This simple, modest attentiveness is something which sets apart the Marist and Sacred Heart Community from others \u2013 the nurturing of \u2018doing good, quietly\u2019 in a school setting encourages hard work, application and mindfulness.  </p>\n\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>All over the College grounds, in windows, on plaques, in the form of benches, artworks or dedicated spaces there are memorials to those members of the school community who have died. Many more of course are recalled through the memories of those who have attended or still attend the college without a physical marker in the grounds to their earthly existence. Each one, in their own way, made a special contribution to the family spirit of Sacred Heart College. </p>\n<p>This stained glass window, created by artist Barry Thompson, who produced most of the windows in the Memorial Chapel, commemorates the life of Bebe Mothopeng 1982-2004. Bebe, a member of the Learners Leadership Council, matriculated from the College in 2001.  She was in the third year of her Bachelor of Education degree at UNISA, completing her teaching practice at Sacred Heart College, when she died in 2004 after a short illness. Like many members of her family, Bebe was a musician and had been a member of both the Soweto Youth Orchestra and the Johannesburg Youth Orchestra as a wind instrumentalist and sang as part of the Nightingale Children\u2019s Choir in her youth. </p>\n\n    ",

    text: "In The Workshop Joseph Letebele holds the Peace Pole that used to stand in the Intermediate Quad in the 1990s. ",
    furtherText: "\n    <p>Brother Joseph, former Primary School Principal, recalled the final school assembly of 1993 when a prayer for peace was said by the whole school. It was said not in anticipation of unrest in the school but rather because it was a time of national uncertainty in the run up to the first democratically held elections in 1994.  This assembly and prayer was described by a visiting German journalist as expressing a spirit of the unity through diversity in the school community and showed hope for the country to develop in this way. The article was read by the Director of the Peace Pole Project (an international organization) who decided Sacred Heart would be a fitting location for a South African Peace Pole to be erected \u2013 to remind onlookers of the importance of peace in a location that has suffered disruption through human injustices.  </p>\n<p>In 1994, in an elaborate ceremony which involved the whole school and members of the wider community, a peace pole was put up to the right hand side of the stage. On its four sides \u201CMay Peace Prevail On Earth\u201D written in isiZulu, Afrikaans, Sesotho and English reminded observers of the message it stood for. After the quad was renovated some years later the pole was removed from its spot. One might guess that it has not been re-installed because the message of tolerance, unity and diversity has long been learnt at Sacred Heart. \n <figure><img src=\"assets/images/points-of-interest/15.7.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n  <figcaption> (Image: C Kamana)</figcaption>\n</figure></p>\n\n    ",
