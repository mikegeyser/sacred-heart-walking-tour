    <p>Uncle Sammy’s retirement is imminent. However, in December 2016, Ntate Sammy said he wasn’t sure if he could retire… ‘as long as these gates are open and I can cycle through them I will want to’ … Indeed, Uncle Sammy can still be found after school with his pushbike and freezer selling his ice creams to learners, parents and staff. In the same conversation Uncle Sammy said “My name isn’t really Uncle Sammy but the boys called me that a long time ago and it stayed, so now I am Uncle Sammy.”</p>

    <p>Uncle Sammy has been selling his ice creams at Sacred Heart College for nearly 55 years, an integral part of and reliable constant in the everyday life of a place that has seen many a transformation. Not only does Uncle Sammy form part of tradition at the College for individuals and families, but for the whole school community. During this conversation in which Brother Neil McGurk speaks about Uncle Sammy, he later said of him, </p>

<p>“characters like that make for a place.”</p>

    <p>Usually to be found in the Orchard during Aftercare, if the weather is bad Uncle Sammy takes his ice-cream cart (from which he also sells popcorn, chips and suckers for those not after ice-cream) into one of the quads. </p>

    <p>Before Uncle Sammy arrives at Sacred Heart, usually at around 2.30 (until after 5pm on a hot day … good for sales!), he stops at the gates of King Edward VII school where he also sells to the KES boys. Therefore, Uncle Sammy is part of the fabric of the wider local community as well as being a familiar figure at Sacred Heart College and in some cases, to whole families. A quick scan of the school and alumni Facebook pages confirms this through the many posts and comments that fondly recall his presence (and presents!).</p>
