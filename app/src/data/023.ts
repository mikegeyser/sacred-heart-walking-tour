    <p>The Most Reverend Damiano consecrated the new College Chapel on 7th October 1956. An Apostolic Delegate represents the Pope in a country where there are no regular diplomatic relations with the Vatican. A Pontifical High Mass is one celebrated by a Bishop, with additional ceremonies; in this case the consecration of the Chapel. ‘Most Reverend’ denotes that Damiano was Archbishop (of the then Transvaal). </p>
<p>The Old Chapel was not officially consecrated (meaning to set apart from this world things for association with the sacred) as a place of worship, rather, it was dedicated. The difference between dedication and consecration is to do with permanence and ownership. Sacred Heart College was built with funds from a mortgage for building works, so the Old Chapel technically didn’t belong to the Marists at the time of the school opening; only once the mortgage had been paid off years later. </p>
<p>All the funds (£20,000 South African pounds, equivalent to about R750,000 today) for the building, decoration and furnishing of the 1956 Chapel were raised by the Ladies’ Committee over ten years through fairs, sales, dances ‘and other ingenious schemes’ (according to the 1956 Maristonian). </p>

    <p>Prior to the opening of the Memorial Chapel the foundation stone was laid and blessed by The Very Reverend Hugh Boyle, Bishop of Johannesburg, in June 1956; fittingly on Champagnat Day. This is commemorated with an engraved stone that can be seen on the outside of the Chapel (front left of the main doors). The Chapel architect was J. W. Van Gemert and the builder J. Brouwers. In accordance with consecration ceremonies, they, along with the extended Marist community seen in this photograph, would have been present in October 1956.  </p>
<p>In this image the original parquet flooring is visible. Over time this was replaced with tiling because of water damage through a ceiling leak. The ceiling was restored and is today exactly as it looked in 1956. Also visible is a stone Altar rail used to demarcate the more holy area of the Chapel (since removed). The Crucifix above the Altar and the same 36 mahogany pews are still in use today; these cost £100 and £1260 respectively at the time. The statues to the left and right of the Chancel area, of Mary and Joseph, came from the Old Chapel.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Chapel&#39;s full title is <strong>The War Memorial Chapel of the Assumption of Our Lady and Blessed Marcellin Champagnat</strong>. The building serves as a place of reverent remembrance for those (Brothers and alumni) who died in both the First and Second World Wars of the twentieth century. A plaque commemorating the 49 Old Boys who died serving in WW1 was erected in the Hall. A plaque for the 78 Old Boys killed in WW2 (named in the 1944 Maristonian) was proposed but never constructed. </p>
<p>The Assumption of Our Lady, celebrated on 15th August, is a feast day marking the ascension of Mary to heaven. The Chapel, built only a year after Champagnat’s Beatification, is dedicated to the Blessed Marcellin Champagnat, rather than to ‘Saint’ Marcellin as he is now venerated. Borbereki, a world-renowned artist, was commissioned specially to create the marble Champagnat sculpture. It was purchased for £300 (approx. R10,500 today). The Altar, made of German sandstone, contains relics of Champagnat.</p>

    <p>Archbishop Hurley grew up on Robben Island, as his father was the lighthouse keeper. Twice President of the South African Catholic Bishops’ Council, he was an outspoken and active opponent of apartheid.</p>
<p>There are twelve stained glass windows in the Chapel. All but one were designed and made by Barry Thompson. Most were added to the Chapel between 2000 and 2004, overseen by the then Primary Principal, Mrs Gorst-Allman. In 1956 the Chapel windows were made of plain glass; the circular windows set high above in the Chancel area remain like this today. The windows were sponsored by individual donors. The Pre-School raised the funds for the window dedicated to St Francis of Assisi. Others were sponsored by families wishing to mark the First Holy Communions of their children. The ‘Safe in the arms of Jesus’ window is dedicated to beloved teacher Penny Frangiskakis, who died in 2002. The ‘Let the children come around Me’ window honours Mary Newman, former Primary School secretary.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Memorial Chapel is not a parish church and as such regular services are not held by the Diocese here. However, during the school week Masses are attended by all High and Primary school pupils, and pupils from Pre-Primary to Matric meet here with Fr Dryden, the school Chaplain. Special services are also held throughout the year, such as the Matric Valedictory. In keeping with the inclusive nature of the school, special Holy Days marked by other faiths are also celebrated in the space, such as Diwali. The Chapel is used for special services outside of school days by alumni and the extended Marist congregation for marriages, memorials and sometimes Ordinations. Performances such as the Pre-Primary nativity are held here as are numerous musical recitals. </p>
<p>Visible in this image is the original 1956 organ, fitted with over 300 pipes. Despite several visits from specialists who have tried to restore it, it is no longer in working order. A portrait of Champagnat similar to Ridolfi’s can be seen to the left of the organ. Four of the fourteen carved and painted Stations of the Cross can be seen in this picture, originally hung in the Old Chapel. On Good Friday, as every year since the establishment of the school, the Marist Brothers lead a walk through 14 stations of reflection and prayer through the grounds, culminating in the Orchard.</p>
