    <p>The Apostolic Delegate (a representative of the Pope in a country where there are no regular diplomatic relations with the Vatican), The Most Reverend Damiano, consecrated the new College Chapel on 7th October 1956. A Pontifical High Mass is one celebrated by a Bishop (Most Reverend as a title denotes an Archbishop as Damiano was at the time of the then Transvaal) with special ceremonies – in this case relating to the consecration of the chapel.</p>
<p>The old Chapel was not officially consecrated (meaning to set apart for association with the sacred rather than with this-world things) as a place of worship, rather dedicated. The difference between blessing/dedication and consecration is to do with permanence and ownership. One can assume this was because Sacred Heart College was built with funds from a mortgage for building works so the old chapel technically didn’t belong (literally) to the Marists at the time of the school opening, only once the mortgage had been paid off years later.</p>
<p>However, the entire funds (£20,000 South African pounds, equivalent to about R750,000 today) for the building, decoration and furnishing of the 1956 chapel were raised by the Ladies Committee over a ten-year period through fairs, sales, dances ‘and other ingenious schemes’ (according to the 1956 Maristonian).</p>

    <p>Prior to the opening of the Memorial Chapel the foundation stone was laid and blessed by The Very Reverend Hugh Boyle, Bishop of Johannesburg, in June 1956; fittingly on Champagnat Day. This is commemorated with an engraved stone that can be seen on outside of chapel (front left of the main doors). The Chapel architect was J. W. Van Gemert and the builder, J. Brouwers. In accordance with consecration ceremonies, they, along with the extended Marist community seen in this photograph would have been present in October 1956.  </p>
<p>In this image the original parquet flooring is visible. Over time this was replaced with tiling because of water damage through a leaking ceiling. The ceiling was restored and is today exactly as it looked in 1956. Also visible is a stone Altar rail used to demarcate the more holy area of the chapel (since removed). The crucifix above the Altar and the same 36 mahogany pews in use today; these cost £100 and £1260 respectively at the time. The statues to the left and right of the chancel area, of Mary and Joseph, came from the old Chapel.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Chapel&#39;s full title is <strong>The War Memorial Chapel of the Assumption of Our Lady and Blessed Marcellin Champagnat</strong>. The building serves as a place of reverent remembrance for those (Brothers and alumni) who died in both the First and Second World Wars of the twentieth century. A plaque commemorating the 49 Old Boys killed in WW1 was erected in the Hall. A plaque for the 78 Old Boys killed in WW2 (named in the 1944 Maristonian) was proposed but never constructed. </p>
<p>The Assumption of Our Lady, celebrated on 15th August, is a feast day marking the ascension of Mary to heaven. The Chapel built only a year after Champagnat’s Beatification is dedicated to the Blessed Marcellin Champagnat, rather than to ‘Saint’ Marcellin as he is now venerated. Borbereki, a world-renowned artist, was commissioned specially to create the marble Champagnat sculpture. It was purchased for £300 (approx. R10 500 today). Other works by Borbereki can be found at the Johannesburg Art Gallery and in Standard Bank’s corporate art collection. The German sandstone Altar contains relics of Champagnat.</p>

    <p>Bishop Hurley, perhaps not as internationally famous those standing next to him, grew up on Robben Island as his father was the lighthouse keeper. Twice President of the South African Catholic Bishops’ Council, he was an outspoken and active opponent of apartheid.
There are twelve stained glass windows in the Chapel. All but one were designed and made by Barry Thompson with most of the stained glass added to the chapel between 2000 and 2004, overseen by the then Primary Principal Mrs Gorst Allman. In 1956 the Chapel windows were made of plain glass; the circular windows set high above in the chancel area remain like this today.</p>
<p>The windows were sponsored by donors for individual reasons.  The Pre-School raised the funds for the window dedicated to St Francis of Assisi and some of the windows were sponsored by families wishing to mark the First Holy Communions of their children. Other windows were installed in remembrance of school staff members. The ‘Safe in the arms of Jesus’ window is dedicated to much loved primary teacher Penny Frangiskakis who died from cancer in 2002. The ‘let the children come around me’ window honours Mary Newman, former Primary School secretary.</p>

    <p>The Memorial Chapel is not a parish church and as such regular services are not held by the Diocese here. However, during the school week Masses are attended by all High and Primary school pupils and pupils from Pre-Primary to Matric meet here with Fr Dryden the school Chaplain. Special services throughout the year are also held, such as the Matric’s valdedictory. In keeping with the inclusive nature of the school, special Holy Days marked other faiths are also celebrated in the space, such as Diwali. The Chapel is used for special services outside of school days by alumni and the extended Marist congregation for marriages, memorials and sometimes Ordinations. Performances such as the Pre-Primary nativity are held here as are numerous musical recitals. </p>
<p>Visible in this image is the original 1956 organ fitted with over 300 pipes. Despite several visits from specialists who’ve tried to restore it, it’s no longer in working order. A portrait of Champagnat similar to Ridolfi’s can be seen to the left of the organ. Four of the fourteen carved and painted Stations of the Cross can be seen in this picture, originally these hung in the old Chapel. On Good Friday, as every year since the establishment of the school, the Marist Brothers lead a walk through 14 stations of reflection and prayer through the grounds, culminating in the Orchard.</p>
