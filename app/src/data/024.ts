    text: "1961, Sodality of Our Lady at Marist ‘Obs’ pictured beneath the statue of Our Lady of Observatory. The Sodality was a society for Catholic boys who wished to grow in faith through dedication to Mary, the Mother of Jesus. As well as prayer meetings and fellowship the society was responsible, through the boys (rather than through religious instruction, Catechism and Mass led by the Brothers), for inspiring Catholic spirit in the College and for charitable works contributing to the wider community.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>The first Sodality began at Koch Street in the late 1880s and soon split into a junior and senior section due to its popularity amongst the boys. When the Senior boys moved to Observatory in 1926, their Sodality moved too. The full title of the Sodality was The Sodality of the Blessed Virgin, Our Lady of Perpetual Succour. By the 1960s the group had become known more colloquially as The Sodality of Our Lady. With the advent of co-education, the Sodality was disbanded at the College to allow for the creation of more inclusive charitable and/or faith led societies. </p>

    text: "This statue is known today as Our Lady of Observatory and was the devotional statue of the now disbanded Sodality of Our Lady. The symbolism of the Virgin Mary with a star on her forehead is connected to the iconography in the Catholic tradition of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>As Our Lady of Perpetual Succour (or ‘help’), Mary is depicted with a star on her veil or forehead, which links to Mary as The Star of the Sea and to whom faithful sailors prayed for safe passage under her protection. In times gone by sailors used the stars as guidance and for the Sodality, formed in the name of Our Lady, this star would have signified Mary’s guidance in their works. Of course, being a Marist Sodality, the relevance of working in the way of and protection by Mary is of great significance.</p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The first College Science Lab was situated where the Primary School reception and Primary School Principal, Mrs Robyn Picas’s, offices are today. In the 1960s, the Science Laboratory moved to the ‘Manual Training Hall’ (later hugely modified to become the Brothers’ Residence), until then used for nationwide compulsory wood/metalwork classes. Brother Raymond, known by the boys as “Cossack”, taught Maths, Science and Latin, and was for some time College Principal and later Marist Provincial. Brother Raymond, who along with Brothers Neil and Rudolph, championed the building of a new science block, died before its completion in 1973. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>The Science Laboratory, in its current location at Sacred Heart College, was built in an area known as “The Glade” adjacent to the College Hall which was covered in pine trees. One of these trees was planted by Councillor Freeman, Principal Rev. Brother Paul and Old Boys’ Association Chairman, Mr. L. Spitz, in 1937 to mark the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps this is the pine tree that still stands at the southern end of the Science block; a photograph in the 1937 Maristonian suggests this might be the case.</p>
<p>Brothers Rudolph and Neil secured funding from Anglo-American to build the new Science Block (and furnish it with top of the range ‘Leybold’ apparatus from Germany). They both taught Science until 1979 in the new building having layed out its interior structure. In 2012 and again in 2015 further funding was received from the Anglo-American Chairman’s Fund, the Italian Bishops Conference, Brother Neil’s fund and other donors for an upgrade and refurbishment of the Science Block. The upgrade brought Science at the College into the 21st century and was received with delight by teaching staff and learners. </p>

    furtherText: `
    <p>Mr. Frank Hollingworth has taught Science at Sacred Heart College for nearly 40 years, having arrived at the school (along with his late wife Barbara who taught History) in 1979. He specialises in Physical Sciences and many of his pupils have gone onto illustrious careers in the Sciences, such as Professor Bruce Watson, matric 1984 (Spectral Theory Expert, Wits University), Dr Ridwan Mia, matric 1993 (award winning plastic surgeon) and Dr David Balchin, matric 2005 (Postdoctoral Fellow at Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry). Until the mid 1980s he coached the 1st XV Rugby and 1st XI Cricket teams and today runs the Sacred Heart College Chess team and clubs. </p>
<p>As well as his professional interest in Science, Mr. Holly is a keen amateur historian and assisted Brother Martin for years compiling the digital section of the Marist Archive. Teddy, Mr. Holly’s beloved Jack Russell, has accompanied him to College every day since 2008, just as Kelly, his Staffordshire Terrier did for the previous decade. </p>

    text: "c.2004; Either side of the Tower are two cypress trees planted in the 1950s by the then Principal, Brother Andrew.",
    furtherText: `
    <p>Brother Andrew, made College Principal two years after his arrival in the country from the Chinese mission, died suddenly in 1964. The palm trees planted here alongside the cypress (and those in front of the College) remain his legacy. Soon after this photograph was taken a learner, conducting her own un-condoned ‘Science Experiment’ involving an aerosol and matches, accidently set fire to one of the trees, not realising quite how powerful the blast created would be. Colin Northmore, the relatively new College Principal, suggested restorative justice to the culprit (who&#39;d immediately come forward) and a new sapling was bought. Unfortunately, the stump of the burnt tree proved impossible to remove. Shortly after the incident, Mr. Northmore was visited by a group of the learner’s peers in his office. They were so distraught at the loss of the tree, which had burst into flames because of the cypress’ highly flammable resin, that they suggested further punishment was necessary. The aforementioned learner removed graffiti that had become an eye-sore in some College bathrooms and latterly developed a keen interest in gardening.  </p>
