    furtherText: "\n    <p>\n    Boarders were admitted to Sacred Heart, Observatory from its opening in 1926 until 1973. Until the second dormitory was added the boarders weren\u2019t all accommodated in the main school, such was the demand for boarding places \u2013 some were lodged in houses in the Observatory neighbourhood and others were put up in spare rooms around the College.  However, this wasn\u2019t satisfactory so the new wing was added. This new wing contained a further dormitory, a library, Chaplain\u2019s rooms and a Sanatorium. The 1937 Maristonian reads \u201Cample accommodation is provided in the handsome and extensive buildings, which, recently erected, have been designed to ensure the comfort and health of the pupils\u201D. The new dormitory was designed to sleep about 60 boarders but later accounts record that each dormitory slept up to 100 boys at a time. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The Brothers slept in rooms in the main College off the other side of the main staircase from the Junior Dormitory (now the upstairs area in which the staff room and administrative offices that belong to the School Counsellor and Chaplain can be found). According to those who still recall those days it was so cold in winter that boys and Brothers sometimes slept underneath their mattresses! The Senior Boarders were luckier \u2013 in the new wing was added electric heating was installed. \n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The second dormitory in the new wing became the Senior Boarders room. The first dormitory, which was then designated to the Junior Boarders, was in the main building. The first dormitory, once an open-plan large room that was designed to sleep up to 50 boys was later partitioned off to make the the classrooms that now situated above the media centre and coffee shop. The senior dormitory was also partitioned off to make classrooms in the late 1970s to allow for the increase in pupil numbers after the school amalgamated with two Convent schools to become Co-Educational in 1980.\n    </p>\n    ",

    furtherText: "\n    <p>\n    The image shows the beds with the head of the bed against the window \u2013 once the boarding numbers increased and space was tight, four rows of beds were packed into the room, with the beds placed parallel to the walls. Each boy had a locker (the tall piece of furniture seen in this photograph) in which to keep their belongings. These had hinged tops which lifted to reveal a space for toiletries and small items. Underneath was a cupboard with shelving used to keep clothing in. Though these items of furniture were called lockers none of them ever had locks on for there were frequent inspections to make sure that everything was in order (and that nothing illicit was kept in the dormitory \u2013 for example food was banned from the dorms). Every item that the boys had at school were labeled with their names and M.C.O.J (Marist College Observatory Johannesburg) and where washed in the college laundry rooms. When boarding was phased out in the 1970s the laundry and ironing rooms were converted into the school workshop (located at the side of The Orchard).  \n    </p>\n    ",

Joffe also recalls thick brown drapes at the end of one of the dormitories behind which rows of pegs were positioned to hang ones blazers on. He also recalled these drapes being particularly useful for boys to hide behind when they were trying to escape being caught out of bed or in the dormitory at prohibited times. \n    </p>\n    ",
