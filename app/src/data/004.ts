    <p>The building was located opposite the school on the other side of the street on the Koch Street/Claim Street corner. In the 1960s when the school closed the boarding house was converted to be used as a nursing home. The man with the beard on the balcony (standing on the left) is Brother Joseph.</p>

    <p>There are at least 33 beds visible in this picture – more are perhaps out of shot of the camera. Note that the bed in the top left corner of the photograph has a rail and curtain suspended around it. It most likely to have belonged to the most senior boy or ‘dormitory captain’ and his privilege of privacy being a reward for holding this position. Apart from a crucifix on the mantelpiece and a small picture in the curtained section there is no decoration in the room.</p>
<p>During the Spanish Influenza epidemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 300,000 South Africans, this dormitory was used as a ward for some of the sick of Johannesburg. They were tended to by the Holy Family Sisters. There were fewer boarders in 1918 due to the reaching effects of the First World War, and those remaining were accommodated locally during this time. </p>

    <p>Boarders were admitted to the College from its opening in 1926 until 1973. Such was the demand for boarding places that some boys were lodged in homes in the Observatory neighbourhood. Others were put up in spare rooms around the College.  However, this wasn’t satisfactory. The new wing that was added doubled boarding capacity and also contained a library, Chaplain’s rooms and the Sanatorium. The 1937 Maristonian reads “ample accommodation is provided in the handsome and extensive buildings, which, recently erected, have been designed to ensure the comfort and health of the pupils”. The Brothers slept in rooms in the main College off the other side of the main staircase from the Junior Dormitory (now the upstairs area where the staff room and administrative offices that belong to the School Counsellor and Chaplain can be found). According to those who still recall those days it was so cold in winter that boys and Brothers sometimes slept underneath their mattresses on top of newspapers! The Senior Boarders were luckier – when the new wing was added, electric heating was installed. </p>
<p>When the school became co-educational in 1980 the dormitories were partitioned off and converted into additional classrooms to accommodate the increase in pupil numbers.</p>

    <p>The image shows the beds with the head of each bed against the window. Once the boarding numbers increased and space was tight, four rows of beds were packed into the room, with the beds placed parallel to the walls. Each boy had a locker (the tall piece of furniture seen in this photograph) where they kept their belongings. These had hinged tops which lifted to reveal a space for toiletries and small items. Underneath was a cupboard with shelving for their clothes. Though these items of furniture were called lockers, none of them ever had locks on for there were frequent inspections to make sure that everything was in order and that nothing illicit was kept in the dormitory – for example, food was banned from the dorms. Every item that the boys had at school was labeled with their names and M.C.O.J (Marist College Observatory Johannesburg) and where washed in the college laundry rooms. When boarding was phased out in the 1970s, the laundry and ironing rooms were converted into the school workshop (located at the side of the Orchard).</p>

<p>“Have you ever noticed that the windows, opposite the Standard 8, 9, 10 classrooms on the top floor of the main building, are of the type that only open slightly? These were put in to stop the boarders climbing out at night! Sometimes they would hurt themselves or damage roof tiles while sneaking out to meet their friends and go to a film at the Piccadilly in Yeoville, or the Victory in Orange Grove. The door at the top of the main staircase was also kept permanently locked in a bid to prevent such nocturnal adventures.”</p>

    <p>As Nolan went onto explain, it was … <img src="assets/images/points-of-interest/03.49b.jpg" alt=""> … He continues by describing a terrible bout of food poisoning that one boy endured as a result of eating the tin of sardines mentioned above. However, this (and the threat of rats) did not seem to deter the boarders from midnight feasts as he recounts several of them, as does another alumnus, E. Joffe, who was a boarder during the 1940s. Joffe also recalls thick brown drapes at the end of one of the dormitories behind which rows of pegs were positioned to hang their blazers on. He also recalled these drapes being particularly useful for boys to hide behind when they were trying to escape being caught out of bed or in the dormitory at prohibited times.</p>
