This experience, and the deep religious faith of his mother and aunt, shaped his life’s path, inspiring his religious vocation and his drive for compassionate education. Despite no formal early schooling, Champagnat wanted to study to become a priest and aged 15 entered a seminary (after twice sitting the entrance exams). He was ordained, aged 26, on 22nd July 1816. The next day Champagnat and some other newly ordained priests went to <strong>Fourvière</strong>, to the shrine of Mary, to pledge their fidelity to her. Together they created a group (to be made up of priests, sisters and lay people) called The Society of Mary with the intention of carrying out their ordained life dedicated to following the example of Mary and to emulate the loving relationship between her and Jesus. </p>\r\n<footer>*words in bold correspond to places circled in red above.</footer>\r\n\r\n    `,\r\n    url: \"assets/images/points-of-interest/01.115b.jpg\",\r\n    reference: \"Image: Marist Archive (annotations Caroline Kamana)\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\npoi.addElement({\r\n    type: 1,\r\n    text: \"Notre Dame de L’Hermitage in 1836.\",\r\n    furtherText: `\r\n    <p>Aged 27 and Curate of the village of <strong>La Valla,*</strong> Marcellin Champagnat visited a sick boy, Jean-Baptiste Montagne, in the remote village of <strong>Les Palais</strong>. The boy died and Champagnat was troubled that he did so without having had any education, spiritual or otherwise. For Champagnat, this experience was a message from God. Thereon, Champagnat vowed to form a brotherhood of teachers to lovingly educate children at the margins of society. On 2nd January 1817, in <strong>La Valla</strong> Champagnat founded Les Petits Frères de Marie (The Little Brothers of Mary or Marist Brothers). In 1823, trapped by heavy falling snow in the mountains near <strong>Graix</strong>, Champagnat prayed to Mary asking for protection, and to her he attributed his survival. Growing quickly, (from three to nearly 30 Brothers in just over five years) the Marist Brotherhood needed new premises, and <strong>Notre Dame De L&#39;Hermitage</strong> opened near St Chamond in 1825.

The first school pupil to arrive at the new school was Peter Busschau (in 2017 there are still Busschaus from the same family at Marist schools). Not long after Busschau’s arrival, a wagonload of boys came from the End Street Convent, run by the Holy Family Sisters, bringing their desks with them. Within the first two years the school roll stood at 300 pupils. In these early days the school was known as Marist Brothers’ College. </p>\r\n<p>The single-storey building in the background was the school house – divided inside with wood and glass panels into three classroom areas. This became the ground floor of the western wing of the Koch street premises as it started to grow.

No longer open veld, the walled playground, which doubled as a cadet training ground and cricket field/soccer pitch, also contained a cottage where the Brothers (and their beehives) resided, a gym, a greenhouse, a woodwork room, a chapel and prototype science laboratory (which pupils were charged an extra fee to use). Space at Koch Street was already becoming tight. </p>\r\n<p>The school was creating quite a reputation for itself in Johannesburg. Gymnastic displays put on by the school became quite a societal fixture, with such big crowds of people turning out to watch that the school yard was not big enough, and the Wanderers grounds were used for displays. The boys were invited to take part in the annual Carnival Procession through the streets of the city and again in special displays (on foot, on bicycles, with gym equipment, in Reed or Brass Bands leading the Cadet Corps) for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1897 and the Coronation of King Edward in 1902.</p>\r\n\r\n    `,\r\n    url: \"assets/images/points-of-interest/02.172.jpg\",\r\n    reference: \"Image: Museum Africa\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\npoi.addElement({\r\n    type: 1,\r\n    text: \"The school, known officially known as Sacred Heart College, after further renovations and extensions in c.1907/8.\",\r\n    furtherText: `\r\n    <p>During the South African War, the school roll dropped to 150 and a part of the school was turned into a military hospital under the care of the French Red Cross, assisted by the Brothers.

By 1914 the school roll was over 600 again and plans began to take shape, not to extend the existing school (impossible due to the ever increasing density of the Doornfontein neighbourhood), but to look for another site further afield. Around 1918 this additional land was found in Observatory and purchased in 1919 by the Marist Provincial (The Revd. Brother Vital) for development as soon as possible, following the settling down of socio-economics after WW1.</p>\r\n<p>In a letter to his Lordship, Right Rev. Dr William Miller, Vicar Apostolic of the Transvaal, written in 1910, Br Frederick defended the particular nature of Sacred Heart School at Koch Street. The Catholic administration had accused the school of not being ‘Catholic’ enough and of having too many ‘other’ pupils. Brother Frederick assured the Right Rev. Miller that Catechism classes, the Rosary and regular Masses made provision for the Catholic boys, of whom there were 135 on the roll. This implies that there were at least 450 non-Catholic children attending the school (at the time most likely Jewish and Protestant children) – a diverse and inclusive Catholic school, as Sacred Heart College remains today. </p>\r\n\r\n    `,\r\n    url: \"assets/images/points-of-interest/02.58c.jpg\",\r\n    reference: \"Image: Museum Africa\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\npoi.addElement({\r\n    type: 1,\r\n    text: \"Aerial view of Sacred Heart College, Koch Street in c.1960.\",\r\n    furtherText: `\r\n    <p>By the 1960s the land around Sacred Heart College was entirely built up.

Jewish learners were supported by weekly instruction from a visiting Rabbi in the 1930s and 40s, while Catholic pupils were encouraged in Catechism and could belong to Sodalities (societies focused on faith). The South African Catholic Bishops Conference (SACBC), to whom the Marists belonged (and in the 1930s had hosted at Observatory) had long been publicly denouncing discriminatory policies. In 1975 the SACBC declared their position with regard to (racially integrated) Open Schooling and in 1976 the Soweto student uprisings brought to the fore this issue at home and internationally.

In 1967, Br Paul founded “The Guild of St. Theresa for the Blind”, a charitable institution, assisted by the Sisters of Charity to practically assist and financially support the blind in disadvantaged communities. The Siloe School for the Blind, near Pietermaritzburg, is one of the foundations supported by St. Theresa’s Guild.

These values can be understood as five pedagogical (or educational practice) pillars or characteristics that uphold and inform the educational framework of the school. These five characteristics are named as presence, simplicity, family spirit, love of work and following the way of Mary. </p>\r\n<p>Mary, the mother of Jesus, is understood as the perfect model of the Marist educator. Faithful and loving, she knew both the joys and the trials of life. In her way, Marist educators seek to lead by example and above all to encourage the personal growth of their learners by establishing relationships with them based on love and humility. The family spirit that is encouraged is evidenced in the relationships built between learners of all ages and at all stages in their school life, supported by their teachers, with whom a strong community is built. This simple, modest attentiveness sets the Marist and Sacred Heart Community apart from others – the nurturing of ‘doing good, quietly’ in a school setting encourages hard work, application and mindfulness.  </p>\r\n\r\n    `,\r\n    url: \"assets/images/points-of-interest/15.02.jpg\",\r\n    reference: \"Image: Caroline Kamana\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\npoi.addElement({\r\n    type: 1,\r\n    text: \"Wolf Hillman and G.M Newton (on right) of the Rotary Club receiving relief-fund gifts at Sacred Heart College in 1932.\",\r\n    furtherText: `\r\n    <p>This photograph, from the archive of Museum Africa, shows Sacred Heart College learners handing over gifts that had been collected in 1932 for a relief fund during the worldwide economic depression, which also affected South Africa.

By the 1980s, the school administration felt that the presence of Cadets contributed to the military culture prevalent within white society at the time, which was not in keeping with the inclusive ethos that the school was demonstrably pioneering. With authority structures being widely discredited through the political struggle in the country it was decided that bastions of such traditional thinking were not appropriate to the school’s progressive and inclusive ethos, and thus the Cadets and the Prefect system were disbanded.

The festival was marked with a procession, Mystery Plays and with the celebration of the Eucharist at several points around the College grounds.

Linda also organised the Cultural Festival, which was the forerunner of the current-day Heritage Day Music Festival. Linda Giuricich is the granddaughter of Richard Hurly, after whose farm Hurlyvale in Edenvale is named. Generations of both the Hurly and Giuricich families attended Koch Street, Marist ‘Obs’ and Yeoville Convent. Richard’s six sons and brother, Henry Hurly, attended Sacred Heart College (at both sites). Of their sons, Richard (junior), was Head Boy and another, Charles, a Springbok soccer player. Ten grandchildren and great-grandchildren followed suit. </p>\r\n<p>The Giuricich brothers, who were builders, brought soil (dug up when building the Rosebank Mall) to level some of the school playing fields in the 1960s. Linda’s grandmother, Myrtle Hurly, chaired the Ladies’ Committee that raised the funds to build The Memorial Chapel. Linda recalls that her grandfather Richard Hurly received the first Marist Brothers who arrived from Kimberley by ox wagon in 1887, as they stopped at the Hurly dairy farm before continuing to Johannesburg. Today Linda runs Aerials Rhythmic Gymnastics club from the College, based at the school since 1980.

Writing in the 1912 Maristonian, Clarence Becker (a Koch Street alumnus), later national selector for the S.A Rugby Association, took the Brothers to task for having &quot;cold-shouldered&quot; rugby.

With the school now co-educational, the hubristic and ‘putting-on-a-pedestal’ tendencies that the sport engendered were no longer appropriate. Many of the boys at the school were also inspired to play soccer by teacher Mickey Lill, a former English Premier League player.

Angela Merici chose St Ursula as the patron saint for the order as she prayed before an image of St Ursula in the church of San Francesco, Brescia (Italy). The first community was established at Brescia. Angela was deeply influenced by the legends surrounding Princess Ursula, a young woman whose faith in God was stronger than death, and who was martyred in the 3rd century along with a group of pious women. </p>\r\n<p>A group of Dutch and British Ursuline Sisters arrived in South Africa in 1895 and settled in Barberton.

The Braamfontein school closed in 1907 and the Sisters transferred to Krugersdorp (later moving to Roodepoort and selling their site to the La Salle Brothers).

The College was deliberately moving away from this old order, which also entailed the disbanding of the Cadets and the de-structuring of the Prefect System. College Principal, Brother Neil McGurk, and Brother Jude Pieterse (then Secretary General of SACBC and Chairperson of the SA Catholic Schools Association) were not only influential in the nation’s forthcoming socio-political transformations, particularly in the area of educational reforms, but were also integral to negotiations with the apartheid government, specifically in talks with the then Administrator of the Transvaal, Sybrand van Niekerk and the Minister of National Education, Piet Koornhof. These talks revealed the divisions beginning to appear within the apartheid regime regarding principles of inclusion in education, with the Brothers offering Catholic principles of inclusivity as a basis for educational reform.

O’Leary, born in Kimberley in 1880, attended the Marist Brothers’ College in Uitenhage. During WW1, O’Leary served as military Chaplain to the Allied Forces in East Africa. O’Leary enjoyed soccer and played cricket for the Marist Old Boys’ team. He was the first South African to join the Episcopacy (the Church government) and was honoured by the Vatican with the positions of Papal Count and Assistant to the Pontifical Throne.</p>\r\n<p>O’Leary died in 1958. The Maristonian noted, “St. David’s College, Inanda, which has been named after him and O’Leary House at Observatory will help to keep ever green the memory of a great friend and counsellor.” </p>\r\n\r\n    `,\r\n    url: \"assets/images/points-of-interest/36.42a.jpg\",\r\n    reference: \"Image: Marist Archive\"\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\npoi.addElement({\r\n    type: 1,\r\n    text: \"Bust of Brother Valerian kept in the Marist Archive.\",\r\n    furtherText: `\r\n    <p>The 75th Anniversary issue of the Maristonian said that “the energy of Brother Valerian underlies every phase of the early history of the school”. Br Valerian, for whom the red house is named, arrived at Koch Street in 1890. The Valerian Prize, also named for him, is awarded for academic excellence to a Junior Matric (grade 11 today). Br Valerian, who was not being able to “disassociate purely scholastic work from physical training”, taught the senior classes as well as gym, athletics and the Cadets. He once took his class to hear the first phonograph in Johannesburg, at the time a huge novelty, and produced the first Maristonian in 1908. </p>\r\n<p>In 1894, only three pupils in the then Transvaal Republic, all Marist learners, were sitting Matric. Br Valerian supervised the boys’ examinations in Bloemfontein. An illuminated manuscript of thanks to Br Valerian from their parents is kept in the Marist archive. Morris Alexander, one of the first pupils in 1889, writing in the 1941 Maristonian, credits Br Valerian for his valuable assistance in getting him through his matric in 1900. In that year the exam papers were brought by military escort from Cape Town. This bust was presented by Old Boys in 1916 as a token of gratitude, dedicated to the memory of Br Valerian, who died in 1914.</p>\r\n\r\n    `,\r\n    url: \"assets/images/points-of-interest/36.16.jpg\",\r\n    reference: \"Image: Caroline Kamana\"\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport var thirtysix = poi;\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/app/data/036.ts","\r\nimport { PointOfInterest } from '../models/point-of-interest';\r\n\r\nvar poi = new PointOfInterest(\"037\", \"Library / Media Centre\", \"Formerly the boarders’ dining room\", -26.173316, 28.075436);\r\n\r\npoi.themes = [\"Alumni\",\"Grounds and Buildings\",\"Learning\",\"Traditions and Innovations\",\"Socio-Political Context\",\"Stories in the story\"];\r\n\r\npoi.addElement({\r\n    type: 1,\r\n    text: \"1928, The Boarders’ Refectory. \",\r\n    furtherText: `\r\n    <p>The room known to learners and staff as the Pulse Media Centre, situated in the Marcia Hyam Library, started off as the Boarders’ Refectory (dining room) when the College opened in 1926.

The Chef served it curried, fried, minced with rice, cold with salad at lunch or hashed with potatoes.

Not unimaginable was the hierarchical system that it created and the likely disproportionate rationing of food between boys of different ages. E. Joffe’s memoir, “Before Mandela’s Rainbow”, reflected on the boarders’ delight at supplementing their meals from the dining room with offerings from the day boys’ packed lunches and with trips to the shops in Yeoville.

The soutanes worn by the Marist Brothers in South Africa are made of a lightweight white fabric, rather than the traditional heavier black version, following dispensation from the General House that it be worn in countries with a hot climate. The soutane was worn with a white rabat (a long rectangular collar) but today the Brothers rather wear a clerical shirt and white banded collar. For the Marists, the rabat signifies their teaching mission. The black cord worn around their waists symbolises being ‘bound’ to God, demonstrating that the Brother has made his first profession (promise) with the Marists. A Brother who wears a crucifix pinned to the front of his soutane demonstrates that he has made his final profession to the Order. Today the soutane is largely kept for formal and religious occasions and the Brothers generally just wear a crucifix or simple Marist cross over a shirt or jersey.</p>\r\n<p>The table and chairs are those used by the Brothers in their Dining Room, restored and repainted for use in the Coffee Shop by Joseph Letebele of the Workshop.
